The influence of MTHFR genetic polymorphisms on adverse reactions after methotrexate in patients with hematological malignancies: a meta-analysis.
The effect of methotrexate (MTX)-related adverse reaction on hematologic neoplasms patients is controversial. We performed this meta-analysis to assess the association between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T/A1298C polymorphism and the adverse reaction after MTX using.                 We searched for qualified studies according to PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science. The meta-analysis was performed by Review Manager 5.3. The analysis was conducted to compare risk ratios (RRs) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) to evaluate the relationship between different toxicity reactions and the genotype of MTHFR.                 We included 17 studies which satisfied with the criteria in this meta-analysis. The results of our statistical analysis showed that no significant correlation between MTHFR C677T/A1298C genetic polymorphism and patients' toxicity or the relapse and survival associated with MTX chemotherapy (P > .05). But we observed that a tendency toward increased risk of hepatotoxicity was also present for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the mutation model (CT/TT vs. CC: RR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.01-3.67; P = .05).                 The polymorphism of MTHFR C677T/A1298C may not be an important indicator for the accurate detection of side effects of chemotherapy after using MTX. More relative research is needed.
