Essential element Cu and non-essential element Hg exposures have different toxicological effects in the liver of large yellow croaker.
The objective was to compare the different effects of essential element Cu and non-essential element Hg on antioxidant and inflammatory responses in the liver of large yellow croaker Larimichthys crocea. Fish were exposed to Cu stresses (72 and 288 μg L-1) and Hg stresses (14 and 56 μg L-1) for 96 h. High-dose Cu increased metallothioneins (MTs) levels and immune defenses in response to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), but low-dose Cu had no effect on ROS. High-dose Hg reduced antioxidant and inflammatory responses, which contributed to the increment of ROS. MTs may be a suitable biomarker to assess Cu contamination, but no relationship was observed between MTs levels and Hg content. Furthermore, NFE2-related nuclear factor 2 (Nrf2) and nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB) were positively related to their respective target genes in the Cu-exposed groups. In conclusion, Cu and Hg induced some differences in antioxidant and inflammatory responses, which providing some novel insights into toxicological effects of Cu and Hg stresses.
