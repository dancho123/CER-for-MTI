Toxic function of CD28 involving in the TLR/MyD88 signal pathway in the river pufferfish (Takifugu obscurus) after exposed to tributyltin chloride (TBT-Cl).
Cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28) is a co-stimulatory receptor found on the surface of T cells. Takifugu obscurus is a kind of anadromous fish species. In this study, the full-length sequence of To-CD28 was obtained, including a 672-bp open reading frame that encodes a peptide chain of 223 amino acids. The phylogenetic analysis showed that To-CD28 is similar to the CD28 protein in Takifugu rubripes. The total hematocyte count distinctly decreased after TBT-Cl exposure, showing the adverse effects of TBT-Cl invasion and self-adjusting ability upon To-CD28 accumulation. The production of reactive oxygen species increased, demonstrating the oxidation resistance of T. obscurus when exposed to TBT-Cl. The tissue expression patterns indicated To-CD28 is a widely distributed receptor in T. obscurus. Its high expression in the liver and gill suggests that To-CD28 could be potentially functioned in TBT-Cl toxic process. The mRNA levels of To-CD28 and relative genes in the TLR-MyD88 signal pathway were significantly up-regulated under TBT-Cl exposure. The immunohistochemistry also showed that the To-CD28 protein signal was enhanced under TBT-Cl exposure, which proved that the positive protection of To-CD28 for maintaining homeostasis. Our study indicated that To-CD28 might participate in the toxicity mechanism upon TBT-Cl exposure and regulate homeostasis stability of T. obscurus.                 Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.
