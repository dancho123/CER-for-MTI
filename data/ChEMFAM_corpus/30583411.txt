The effect of cooking on umami compounds in wild and cultivated mushrooms.
The effect of cooking on the taste compounds of five mushroom species Agaricus bisporus, Lactarius trivialis, Cantharellus cibarius, Cantharellus tubaeformis and Suillus variegatus were assessed with a special focus on the compounds responsible for the umami taste. Liquid chromatography was used to analyse free amino acids (FAAs) and 5'-nucleotides from fresh and sous vide (SV) cooked mushroom samples and cooking juice. The SV technique enabled analysis of entire mushrooms, including the liquid released during cooking. FAA content decreased when cooking temperature increased, indicating their further chemical reactions. S. variegatus contained highest concentrations of FAAs in analysed wild mushrooms. The umami-enhancing nucleotide 5'-GMP was detected only in cooked samples, concentration being likely dependent on enzymatic activity. The highest concentration of 5'-GMP was detected in cooked L. trivialis samples (17 mg/100 g fw). To our knowledge, the analysed taste compounds of L. trivialis and S. variegatus are documented for the first time.                 Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
