Transcriptional response of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters to insecticides in the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera.
When any living organism is frequently exposed to any drugs or toxic substances, they evolve different detoxification mechanism to confront with toxicants during absorption and metabolism. Likewise, the insects have evolved detoxification mechanisms as they are frequently exposed to different toxic secondary plant metabolites and commercial insecticides. ABC transporter superfamily is one of the largest and ubiquitous group of proteins which play an important role in phase III of the detoxification process. However, knowledge about this gene family remains largely unknown. To help fill this gap, we have identified a total of 54 ABC transporters in the Helicoverpa armigera genome which are classified into eight subfamilies (A-H) by phylogenetic analysis. The temporal and spatial expression profiles of these 54 ABC transporters throughout H. armigera development stages and seven tissues and their responses to five different insecticides, were investigated using RNA-seq analysis. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of eight selected genes in different tissues and six genes responses to insecticides were confirmed by the quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Moreover, H. armigera become more sensitive to abamectin and indoxacarb when P-gp was inhibited. These results provide a foundation for further studies of ABCs in H. armigera.
