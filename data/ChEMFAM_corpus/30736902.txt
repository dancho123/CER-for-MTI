Reactivity of microglia and astrocytes after an excitotoxic injury induced by kainic acid in the rat spinal cord.
After injury of the nervous system glial cells react according to the stimuli by modifying their morphology and function. Glia activation was reported in different kainic acid (KA)-induced neurodegeneration models. Here, we describe glial morphometric changes occurring in an excitotoxic KA-induced cervical spinal cord injury model. Concomitant degenerative and apoptotic processes are also reported. Male rats injected at the spinal cord C5 segment either with KA or saline were euthanized at post-injection (PI) days 1, 2, 3 or 7. Anti-IBA-1 and anti-GFAP antibodies were used to identify microglia and activated astrocytes, respectively, and to morphometrically characterized them. Fluoro-Jade B staining and TUNEL reaction were used to determine neuronal and glial degeneration and apoptosis. KA-injected group showed a significant increase in microglia number at the ipsilateral side by PI day 3. Different microglia reactive phenotypes were observed. Reactive microglia was still present by PI day 7. Astrocytes in KA-injected group showed a biphasic increase in number at PI days 1 and 3. Degenerative and apoptotic events were only observed in KA-injected animals, increasing mainly by PI day 1. Understanding the compromise of glia in different neurodegenerative processes may help to define possible common or specific therapeutic approaches directed towards neurorestorative strategies.
