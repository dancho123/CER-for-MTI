Efflux pump systems constitute a major means of intrinsic resistance in Escherichia coli. AcrEF-TolC pump is known to exhibit higher expression level in quinolone resistant isolates. However, the transcriptional response of this pump is yet to be known when exposed to quinolone and other group of antibiotics.
The present study analyses the transcriptional response of AcrEF-TolC in the presence of quinolones and carbapenems.
A total of 167 non-duplicate clinical isolates from Silchar medical college and Hospital, Silchar, India were included in this study. Of which 27 were devoid of any carbapenemase activity and among them 13 isolates showed overexpression of AcrE and AcrF gene. Transcriptional response of AcrE was directly proportional to increasing concentration of levofloxacin and ofloxacin. However, the response of AcrE and AcrF was inconsistent with carbapenems.
The study isolates showed susceptibility towards amikacin (68.4%), gentamicin (59.6%), cefepime (52.7%) and pipercillin/tazobactam (48.3%). The present investigation highlights that apart from qnr genes and mutational changes in gyr region, AcrEF-TolC plays a major role in fluoroquinolone resistance in this part of the world.
Upregulation of AcrE in the presence of levofloxacin and ofloxacin warrants further investigation to establish their active role in efflux of this drug.
