Hypertension regulating angiotensin peptides in the pathobiology of cardiovascular disease.
Renin angiotensin system (RAS) is an endogenous hormone system involved in the control of blood pressure and fluid volume. Dysregulation of RAS has a pathological role in causing cardiovascular diseases through hypertension. Among several key components of RAS, angiotensin peptides, varying in amino acid length and biological function, have important roles in preventing or promoting hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, vascular remodeling etc. These peptides are generated by the metabolism of inactive angiotensinogen or its derived peptides by hydrolyzing action of certain enzymes. Angiotensin II, angiotensin (1-12), angiotensin A and angiotensin III bind primarily to angiotensin II type 1 receptor and cause vasoconstriction, accumulation of inflammatory markers to sub-endothelial region of blood vessels and activate smooth muscle cell proliferation. Moreover, when bound to angiotensin II type 2 receptor, angiotensin II works as cardio-protective peptide and halt pathological cell signals. Other peptides like angiotensin (1-9), angiotensin (1-7), alamandine and angiotensin IV also help in protecting from cardiovascular diseases by binding to their respective receptors.
