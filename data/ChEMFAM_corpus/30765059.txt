Benzothiazole inhibits the growth of Phytophthora capsici through inducing apoptosis and suppressing stress responses and metabolic detoxification.
Benzothiazole (BZO) is an antimicrobial secondary metabolite volatilized by many plants and microbes. However, the mechanism of BZO against phytopathogens is still unclear. Here, we found that BZO has antimicrobial activity against the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora capsici. Transcriptome and proteome analyses demonstrated that BZO significantly suppressed the expression of genes and proteins involved in morphology, abiotic stress defense and detoxification, but induced the activity of apoptosis. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining confirmed that the process of apoptosis was significantly induced by BZO at concentration of 150 mg L-1. FITC-phalloidin actin-cytoskeleton staining combined with hyphal cell wall staining and hyphal ultrastructure studies further confirmed that BZO disrupted the cell membrane and hyphal morphology through disrupting the cytoskeleton, eventually inhibiting the growth of hyphae. These data demonstrated that BZO has multiple modes of action and may act as potential leading compound for the development of new oomycete fungicides. These results also showed that the combination of transcriptomic and proteomic approaches was a useful method for exploring the novel antifungal mechanisms of natural compounds.
