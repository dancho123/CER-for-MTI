Identification and molecular analysis of a lncRNA-HOTAIR transcript from secondary hair follicle of cashmere goat reveal integrated regulatory network with the expression regulated potentially by its promoter methylation.
The HOTAIR transcript is transcribed from the antisense strand within the HOXC gene cluster, and it is thought to play a role in regulating the inductive capacity of dermal papilla cells during the reconstruction of hair-follicle. In the current investigation, we firstly isolated and characterized a lncRNA-HOTAIR transcript from the secondary hair follicle of cashmere goat. Also, we analyzed its transcriptional pattern and methylation level of HOTAIR gene promoter in secondary hair follicle of cashmere goat during anagen and telogen stages. Nucleotide composition analysis indicated that the contents of Adenine (A) and Thymine (T) are higher than that of Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) in lncRNA-HOTAIR transcript of cashmere goat with the highest frequency distribution of AG nucleotide pair (8.06%). The regulatory network analysis showed a directly or indirectly complex regulatory relationships between lncRNA-HOTAIR of cashmere goat and its potential target molecules: miRNAs, mRNAs and proteins. Also, we showed that lncRNA-HOTAIR was properly transcribed at both anagen and telogen stages of secondary hair follicle of cashmere goat with the anagen being significantly higher than telogen in its expression, which suggest that lncRNA-HOTAIR transcript might be involved in the reconstruction of secondary hair follicle with the formation and growth of cashmere fiber. Taken together with methylation analysis of HOTAIR gene promoter, our data suggest that the promoter methylation of HOTAIR gene most likely is involved in its transcriptional suppression in secondary hair follicle of cashmere goat.
