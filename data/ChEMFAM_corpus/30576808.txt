Circular RNA HIPK3 promotes glioma progression by binding to miR-124-3p.
This study aims to investigate whether circ-HIPK3 could promote the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells by upregulating STAT3 after binding to miR-124-3p, thus participating in the development of glioma. Expression levels of circ-HIPK3, miR-124-3p and STAT3 in glioma cell lines were determined using qRT-PCR. The regulatory effects of circ-HIPK3, miR-124-3p and STAT3 on proliferative and invasive capacities of glioma cells were accessed using EdU assay, CCK-8 assay and invasion assay, respectively. Cell cycle assay and cell apoptosis assay were performed by flow cytometry. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted to determine the binding condition among circ-HIPK3, miR-124-3p and STAT3. Rescue experiments were performed in co-transfected glioma cells. QRT-PCR data showed that circ-HIPK3 and STAT3 are highly expressed, whereas miR-124-3p is lowly expressed in glioma cells than those of negative control cell. Knockdown of circ-HIPK3 in U87 and U251 cells inhibited their proliferative and invasive capacities. On the contrary, miR-124-3p knockdown improved proliferative and migratory capacities. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay exerted that circ-HIPK3 could bind to miR-124-3p and STAT3 is the target gene of miR-124-3p. Western blot results elucidated that circ-HIPK3 stabilizes STAT3 expression, whereas miR-124-3p degrades STAT3 expression. Rescue experiments demonstrated that overexpression of circ-HIPK3 could partially reverse the inhibited proliferative and migratory capacities induced by miR-124-3p in U87 and U251 cells. In summary, we found that overexpression of circ-HIPK3 promotes proliferative and invasive capacities of glioma cells by sponging miR-124-3p to upregulate STAT3 expression.
