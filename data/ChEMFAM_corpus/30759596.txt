Low concentrations of copper oxide nanoparticles alter microbial community structure and function of sediment biofilms.
In this study, we investigated the effects of copper oxide (CuO) NPs on freshwater sediment biofilms in terms of the functional properties and microbial community structure. Biofilms were incubated in microcosms and CuO NPs (1 mg/L uncoated and humic-acid-coated) were exposed with Cu2+ (Cu(NO3)2) as the positive control. As determined from DO (dissolved oxygen) microelectrodes measurements, a high-DO region emerged inside the biofilms after 5-day exposure to CuO NPs compared with those before NP additions, which suggested CuO NPs inhibit the oxygen respiration activity. These results were consistent with the decreased heterotrophic respiration. CuO NPs significantly altered the bacterial community composition and decreased the abundances of Anaerolineaceae, Acidobacteria, Aminicenantes, and Anaerolinea. Functional analysis from PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States)-predicted metagenomes indicated that bacterial genera depleted by CuO NP treatments were related to carbohydrate and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites. These functional profiles combined with the decreased activities of extracellular enzymes, β-glucosidase (GLU) and l-leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), suggested that the introduction of CuO NPs exhibit negative effects on the biogeochemical processes and the cycling of carbon and nitrogen in biofilm systems. Whereas these toxic effects of CuO NPs could be mitigated when the aquatic environment is enriched with natural organic matters such as humic acid.                 Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
