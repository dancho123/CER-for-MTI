Characteristics of one-year observation of VOCs, NOx, and O3 at an urban site in Wuhan, China.
A continuous online observation of ozone and its precursors (NOx, VOCs) was carried out in central urban Wuhan from September 2016 to August 2017. The concentration levels of ozone, NOx, VOCs and their variations in urban Wuhan were analyzed, as well as effects of VOCs on ozone photochemical generation and the main controlling factors for ozone production. During the observation period, the average concentrations of ozone and NOx in Wuhan was 22.63 and 30.14 ppbv, respectively, and the average concentration of VOCs was 32.61 ppbv (42.3% alkanes, 13.0% alkenes, 10.0% aromatics, 7.3% acetylene, 9.9% OVOCs, and 10.5% halohydrocarbons). Ozone concentration was higher in spring and summer as compared with autumn and winter, wheras VOCs and NOx concentratios were lower in spring and summer but higher in autumn and winter. Aromatics and alkenes, two of VOCs species, showed the highest contributions to ozone formation potential in Wuhan (35.7% alkenes, 35.4 aromatics, 17.5% alkanes, 8.6% OVOCs, 1.6% halogenated hydrocarbons, and 1.4% acetylene). Among all VOCs species, those with the highest contribution were ethylene, m-xylene, toluene, propylene and o-xylene. The contribution of these five compounds to the total ozone formation potential concentration was 43.90%. Ozone-controlling factors in Wuhan changed within one day; during the early morning hours (6:00-9:00), VOCs/NOx was low, and ozone generation followed a VOCs-limited regime. However, during the peak time of ozone concentration (12:00-16:00), the ratio of VOCs/NOx was relatively high, suggesting that ozone generation followed a NOx-limited regime.
