HS-SPME-GC-MS/olfactometry combined with chemometrics to assess the impact of germination on flavor attributes of chickpea, lentil, and yellow pea flours.
In this study, volatile component changes of germinated chickpea, lentil, and yellow pea flours over the course of 6 days germination were characterized by HS-SPME-GC-MS/O. In total, 124 volatile components were identified involving 19 odor active components being recorded by GC-O exclusively. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) revealed that lentil and yellow pea flours had the similar aromatic attributes, while the decrease of beany flavor compounds along with the occurrence of unpleasant flavors was detected in chickpea flours upon germination. Six beany flavor markers, including hexanal, (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal, (E,E)-2,4-decadienal, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 1-hexanol, and 2-pentyl-furan, were employed to quantify beany flavor formation in the flours over the course of germination. The results suggested that no significant beany flavor formation or mitigation was appeared after 1 day of germination. The findings are crucial for tailing pulse germination process to enhance the macronutrients without increasing undesirable beany flavor.                 Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
