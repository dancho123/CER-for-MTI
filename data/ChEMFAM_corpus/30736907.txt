Non-integrin laminin receptors in epithelia.
The interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) play a major role in normal and pathological conditions. The ECM can modulate several biological functions including cell proliferation, adhesion, differentiation and survival through its interactions with cell receptors. Laminins are one of the most important glycoproteins present in basement membranes, a type of ECM. The pattern of expression of its different isoforms depends on the spatiotemporal organization of each tissue. While integrins are the most studied laminin receptors, other non-integrin laminin receptors are also involved. This review focuses on two particular non-integrin laminin receptors in the epithelial context: dystroglycan and 37/67 laminin receptor (37/67LR). Dystroglycan is a two-subunit protein discovered in the muscle as part of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex. This protein can also be found in many epithelia where its roles are variable. The 37/67LR is a still incompletely understood laminin receptor that is important to regulate intestinal epithelial cell function and could be involved in various pathological conditions.
