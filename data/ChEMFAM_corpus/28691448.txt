Evaluation of chemical-physical properties and cytocompatibility of TheraCal LC.
TheraCal LC (TLC, Bisco Inc., Schaumburg, IL, USA) is a light-cured, resin-modified, calcium silicate-filled base/liner material designed for direct and indirect pulp-capping. In this study the result of the evaluation in vitro of the biocompatibility and chemical-physical properties of TLC are reported. TLC specimens were prepared under aseptic conditions in strict compliance with the manufacturerÂ’s instructions and sterilized. Osteoblast-like cells (MG63) were used. For different time points, solubility, water uptake, alkalinizing activity and cytotoxicity were evaluated. In ddH20 and in DMEM+FBS, TLC showed a loss of material increasing simultaneously with the absorption capacity. The increase of water uptake of the material promoting the solubilization of mineral ions in medium is a requisite for a bioactive material. The alkalinizing activity is correlated to antimicrobial/bacteriostatic activity and to the ability to favor the formation of apatite deposits. The pH values for water absorption after immersion of the disks ranged between 8 and 9 at each times of evaluation. Cytotoxicity was not observed in MG63 cells treated with TLC and after 5 days, the cells were organized to form a confluent monolayer as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy observation. TLC showed biocompatibility on MG63 cells allowing a physiologic cell growth and differentiation. The chemical-physical properties and biocompatibility of TLC observed in vitro in the present study, allows considering this cement as an innovative pulp-capping material for the vital pulp therapy.
