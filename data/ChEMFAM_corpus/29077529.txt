Postnatal melatonin treatment protects against affective disorders induced by early-life immune stimulation by reducing the microglia cell activation and oxidative stress.
Systemic inflammation induced by neonatal infection may result as long-term hyper-activation of microglial cells followed by an overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric oxide and lipid peroxidation. Those inflammation mediators can trigger behavioral disruption and/or cognitive disorders.                 The present work aims to evaluate the effect of melatonin (a cytokine release modulator and antioxidant agent) in the reduction of the prefrontal microglia activation and depressive-like behaviors induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection in adult rats.                 The effect of melatonin (5 mg/kg) was compared to minocycline (50 mg/kg), a well-known anti-inflammatory drug with potent inhibitory effect on microglial activation. Our results showed that LPS injection induced a significant increase in prefrontal cortex tumor necrosis factor-alpha and nitric oxide levels. Furthermore, lipid peroxidation and microglial activation were highly increased in the prefrontal cortex compared to control. The melatonin treatment induced a significant decrease on nitric oxide and lipid peroxidation levels in the prefrontal cortex and significant decrease on tumor necrosis factor-alpha and microglia activation. Melatonin can also induce a significant reduction in the anxiety and depression-like effect induced by PND9 LPS administration.                 Our results demonstrated that melatonin possesses potent protective effect against the depression and anxiety induced by LPS. The underlying effect of melatonin is probably due to the reduction of nitric oxide toxic effect and lipid peroxidation in addition to its anti-inflammatory effect.
