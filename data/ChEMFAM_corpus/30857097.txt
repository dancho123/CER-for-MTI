Distribution of perfluorinated compounds (PFASs) in the aquatic environment of the industrially polluted Vaal River, South Africa.
Perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) are highly persistent chemicals, which have a bioaccumulative potential and can be found in wildlife around the world. Although multiple studies have been performed on PFASs pollution of the aquatic environment, little is known on PFASs pollution on the African continent and their possible risks for human health. In the present study, we examined the distribution of 15 PFASs in fish, invertebrates, sediment and water, collected at three sites, representing a gradient of industrial and mining pollution, along the Vaal River, South Africa. Furthermore, possible risks for human health through consumption of contaminated fish were examined. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the most dominant PFAS measured in biota, whereas perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) was measured in higher concentrations in water. Mean PFAS concentrations in water ranged from <LOQ to 38.5ng/L. PFAS concentrations in water decreased along the gradient and were similar or lower compared to other studies in Europe, Asia and America. PFAS measurements in sediment were <LOQ, with the exception of PFOS at Thabela Thabeng (2.36ng/g dry weight (dw)). Average ∑PFAS concentrations in biota increased along the gradient and ranged from <LOQ to 34.5ng/g wet weight (ww) in invertebrates, <LOQ to 289ng/g ww in liver and <LOQ to 34.0ng/g ww in muscle tissue. Although PFOS concentrations were relatively high compared to literature, concentrations of other PFASs were rather low. A potential risk for humans through consumption of PFAS-contaminated fish was assessed. Tolerable daily intake values (grams of fish that can be eaten daily without risking health effects) were much lower than the average South African fish consumption per day, implying a potential risk for human health through consumption of PFAS contaminated fish. CAPSULE: Concentrations of perfluorinated compounds in water, sediment, fish and invertebrates from the Vaal River were low or intermediate and posed a potential risk for human health through consumption of contaminated fish.
