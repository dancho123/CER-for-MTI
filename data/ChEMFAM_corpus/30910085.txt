Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of the food spoilage bacterium Brochothrix thermosphacta.
Microbial food spoilage is responsible for significant economic losses. Brochothrix thermosphacta is one of the major bacteria involved in the spoilage of meat and seafood. Its growth and metabolic activities during food storage result in the production of metabolites associated with off-odors. In this study, we evaluated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity of this species. A collection of 161 B. thermosphacta strains isolated from different foods, spoiled or not, and from a slaughterhouse environment was constituted from various laboratory collections and completed with new isolates. A PCR test based on the rpoB gene was developed for a fast screening of B. thermosphacta isolates. Strains were typed by MALDI-TOF MS, rep-PCR, and PFGE. Each typing method separated strains into distinct groups, revealing significant intra-species diversity. These classifications did not correlate with the ecological origin of strains. The ability to produce acetoin and diacetyl, two molecules associated with B. thermosphacta spoilage, was evaluated in meat and shrimp juices. The production level was variable between strains and the spoilage ability on meat or shrimp juice did not correlate with the substrate origin of strains. Although the B. thermosphacta species encompasses ubiquitous strains, spoiling ability is both strain- and environment-dependent.
