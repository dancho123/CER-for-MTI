Zinc finger antisense 1: A long noncoding RNA with complex roles in human cancers.
Zinc finger antisense 1 (ZFAS1), a newly identified long non-coding RNA, is a transcript antisense to the 5' end of the protein-coding gene zinc finger NFX1-type containing 1 which hosts three C/D-box small nucleolar RNAs (SNORDs) within sequential introns: Snord12, Snord12b, and Snord12c. ZFAS1 is dysregulated and acts as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor in different human malignancies. ZFAS1 has been implicated in many aspects of carcinogenesis, including proliferation, invasion, metastasis, apoptosis, cell cycle, and drug resistance. The mechanisms underlying the effects of ZFAS1 are complex and involve multiple signaling pathways. In this review, the multiple pathological functions of ZFAS1 in diverse malignancies are systematically reviewed to elucidate the molecular basis of its biological roles and to provide new directions for future research.
