Comparative Study of Chemical, Biochemical Characteristic and ATR-FTIR Analysis of Seeds, Oil and Flour of the Edible Fedora Cultivar Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.).
A series of chemical and biochemical parameters of edible hemp resources (seeds, oil, and flour) from the monoecious EU registered hemp genotype Fedora, was determined, including fatty acid profile, phytosterol composition, total phenolics, antioxidant activity, macro- and micro-elements. The fatty acid ω-3/ω-6 approached the nutritionally optimal 3/1 ratio. β-sitosterol and other phytosterols sterols dominated the unsaponifiable fraction. Hemp seeds, flour, and oil contained 767 ± 41, 744 ± 29, and 21 ± 5 mg GAE kg-1 total polyphenols, respectively. The antioxidant potential of Fedora flour and seeds, evaluated through the DPPH (2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assay, was higher than that of oil. K and Mg were the most abundant macro-elements, particularly in flour, while the concentration of trace elements was Fe > Cu > Ni > Mn. The presence of an array of bioactive compound candidate Fedora products as health-promoting food matrices. The ATR-FTIR spectra of hemp-derived products indicated the proximate composition of macro-nutrients.
