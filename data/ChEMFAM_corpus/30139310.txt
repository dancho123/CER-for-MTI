Comparative study of bone marrow and blood plasma levels of IL-2 in aplastic anaemia and their relationship with disease severity.
Interleukin-2 (alias: IL-2, TCGF, Lymphokine), a type of interleukin, is also a potent signalling molecule in the signalling cascade of the immune-mediated activation of T Lymphocytes leading to the destruction of haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) which is the basis of acquired aplastic anaemia (AAA). The objective was to study the association of IL-2 in the bone marrow plasma (BMP) and peripheral blood plasma (PBP) in AAA patients.                 A total of 52 BMP and PBP-paired samples (both from the same patients) was collected from the confirmed AAA patients and 10 healthy individuals. The level of IL-2 was measured by the quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis.                 Significantly increased level of IL-2 was observed in the BMP than PBP of AAA patients. The level of IL-2 in PBP and BMP was found to be very low in the control cases. Considerably increased levels of IL-2 were found in the PBP and BMP of AAA patients as compared to controls (48.54 ± 21.89 vs. 1.99 ± 1.25 p-value < 0.00001) and (75.33 ± 41.9 vs. 3.12 ± 1.82; p-value < 0.00001) respectively. Among these patients, the IL-2 levels were higher in patients with Very Severe Aplastic Anaemia (VSAA) and Severe Aplastic Anaemia (SAA) than those with Non-severe Aplastic Anaemia (NSAA) in the PBP (65.6 ± 23.61 vs. 31.72 ± 7.64; p-value 0.00338) and (45.37 ± 16.25 vs. 31.72 ± 7.64; p-value 0.01468) respectively. Again the IL-2 levels were higher in patients with VSAA and SAA than those with NSAA in the BMP (115.01 ± 38.91 vs. 38.32 ± 19.49; p-value < 0.00001) and (66.44 ± 23.34 vs. 38.32 ± 19.49; p-value 0.0006). The IL-2 level was higher in VSAA than SAA in PBP (65.6 ± 23.61vs. 45.37 ± 16.25; p-value 0.0114) and BMP (115.01 ± 38.91 vs. 66.44 ± 23.34; p-value 0.00044).                 This study emphasized on the bone marrow and blood plasma levels of IL-2 in aplastic anaemia and their relationship with disease severity. The results indicate towards the fact that IL-2 may have an important association with the marrow failure of AAA patients and thus can help in disease development. Further study is necessary for better understanding.
