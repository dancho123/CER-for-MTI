Oxidative stress and renal toxicity after subacute exposure to decabrominated diphenyl ether in Wistar rats.
Fully brominated diphenyl ether (BDE-209) is a flame retardant widely used in plastics and textiles. Because of its high persistence, humans are exposed to it continuously, mainly via dust ingestion. We investigated effects of BDE-209 on renal function and oxidative stress development in the kidney after subacute exposure in rats. Five groups of animals were given by oral gavage 31.25-500 mg BDE-209/kg b.w./day for 28 days, and relative kidney weight, serum urea and creatinine, and oxidative stress parameters in the kidney were determined. Benchmark-dose approach was used for dose response modeling. Serum creatinine was increased, while results obtained for serum urea were inconclusive. Relative kidney weight was not affected by BDE-209. Kidney reduced glutathione was elevated, while superoxide dismutase activity was not changed after BDE-209 treatment. Also, levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were increased and total -SH groups were decreased, which indicated oxidative imbalance. The critical effect dose (CED)/CEDL ratios for the effects on TBARS and total -SH groups indicated estimated CEDs for these markers can be used in risk assessment of BDE-209. Our study results have shown that a relatively low dose of BDE-209 affects kidney function and that oxidative stress is one of the mechanisms of its nephrotoxicity.
