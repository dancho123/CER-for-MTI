The effect of docosahexaenoic acid on apelin distribution of nervous system in the experimental mouse model of Parkinson's disease.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder of the human central and peripheral nervous systems. n-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22: 6n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as well as apelin have anti-inflammatory effects in various cells. At the same time, apelin has anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects. The study was conducted to determine the effect of DHA on the distribution of apelin and apelin receptor (APJ) in the central nervous system in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model. DHA treatment decreased the return time and total down time in the Parkinson group which were measured by pole test. Besides, the ambulatory activity, distance and total locomotor activity were increased by DHA in the PD model of animals. The time mice remained on the rotating rod mile was also significantly increased by DHA treatment in MPTP injected animals. The apelin expression in the pons of mice in the Parkinson, DHA and Parkinson + DHA groups were lower compared to the Control group. When apelin and apelin receptor expressions in cerebrum were examined, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. When apelin receptor expression in cerebellum was examined, the difference between the Control and Parkinson + DHA, Parkinson and Parkinson + DHA, DHA and Parkinson + DHA groups were statistically significant. Apelin receptor expressions in pons of the Parkinson, DHA and Parkinson + DHA groups were lower compared to the Control group. Apelin protein levels of cerebellum and pons were found to be decreased in DHA group compare with Control group. In conclusion; DHA has been implicated in the expression of the apelin receptor and has reduced the expression of APJ receptor.                 Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
