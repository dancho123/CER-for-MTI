Mapping the location of DATEM in multi-phase systems: Synthesis and characterization of spin-label probe analogues.
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy has emerged as a fast, reliable, non-invasive and sensitive method to determine the distribution, localization and reactivity of labelled ingredients in micro-heterogeneous systems. However, the commercially available probe molecules are very limited. In the present work, five new nitroxide [(4-hydroxy-2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPOL)] derivatives (1b-5b) of diacetyl tartaric acid esters of monoglycerides (DATEM) (1a-5a), a widely used food emulsifier, were synthesized under Steglich conditions and characterized by MS (mass-spectrometry), FT-IR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy), EPR, NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy), fluorescence spectroscopy, and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) analysis. Phase partitioning studies proved that the new spin labels are adequately capable of describing the localizations and partitioning of the corresponding DATEM in multi-phase systems. Findings disclosed in this work will provide new knowledge on ingredient reactivity and localization in multi-phase systems; which is vital to aid the design of more efficient delivery systems for bioactive compounds.
