Pymetrozine activates TRPV channels of brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.
The commercial insecticide pymetrozine has been extensively used for brown planthopper control in East Asia. The transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channel, which consists of two proteins, Nanchung (Nan) and Inactive (Iav), has recently been shown to be the molecular target of pymetrozine in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum). In this study, we characterized the Nan and Iav TRPV channel subunits of N. lugens and measured the action of pymetrozine on them. NlNan and NlIav are structurally similar to homologs from other insects. The expression pattern analysis of various body parts showed that NlNan and NlIav were both more abundantly expressed in antennae. When NlNan and NlIav were co-expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, they formed channels with high sensitivity to pymetrozine (EC50 = 5.5 × 10-8 M). Behavioral observation revealed that the gravitaxis defect in the fruit fly nan36a mutant was rescued by ectopically expressed NlNan and the rescued behavior could be abolished by pymetrozine. Our results confirm that NlNan and NlIav co-expressed complexes can be activated by pymetrozine both in vitro and in vivo and provide useful information for future resistance mechanism studies.
