Spinocerebellar ataxia 27 with a novel nonsense variant (Lys177X) in FGF14.
Spinocerebellar ataxia 27 (SCA27) is an autosomal dominant SCA caused by variants in the fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) gene. We examined a Japanese SCA patient whose deceased father also suffered from SCA. The patient was a 63-year-old male. He graduated from junior high school but received no further education. The predominant complaint was slowly progressive dysarthria and gait disturbance, which appeared at age 47. He showed pathological saccadic dysmetria, saccadic intrusions into smooth pursuit eye movements, dysarthria, and limb and truncal ataxia. His gait was wide-based but he did not require a walking stick. Limb muscle strength was intact. Deep tendon reflexes were normal or slightly reduced. Pathological reflexes were absent. He demonstrated mildly impaired vibration sense in the lower limbs. There was no urinary dysfunction. Brain MRI showed cerebellar atrophy without brainstem involvement. We first confirmed the absence of repeat expansion in genes known to be responsible for SCAs 1-3, 6-8, 10, 12, 17, 36 and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. By exome analysis, we identified a novel heterozygous variant (NM_004115, c.529A>T; Lys177X) in exon 4 of the FGF14 gene. This variant is expected to generate a truncated FGF14 protein lacking the heparin binding sites, those are likely to modify the activity of FGF14. We confirmed the absence of the variant in 502 healthy Japanese individuals by Sanger sequencing. There is no record of the variant in public databases. We conclude that the novel variation in FGF14 is causative for SCA27 in this patient.                 Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.
