Maize factors ZmUBP15, ZmUBP16 and ZmUBP19 play important roles for plants to tolerance the cadmium stress and salt stress.
Ubiquitin-Specific Protease16 (UBP16) has been described involved in cadmium stress and salt stress in Arabidopsis, however nothing is known about the functions of its homologs in maize. In this study, we investigate the functions of ZmUBP15, ZmUBP16 and ZmUBP19, three Arabidopsis UBP16 homologs in maize. Our results indicate that ZmUBP15, ZmUBP16 and ZmUBP19 are ubiquitously expressed throughout plant development, and ZmUBP15, ZmUBP16 and ZmUBP19 proteins are mainly localized in plasma membrane. Complementation analyses show that over-expression of ZmUBP15 or ZmUBP16 can rescue the defective phenotype of ubp16-1 in cadmium stress. In addition, over-expression of ZmUBP15, ZmUBP16 or ZmUBP19 can increase the plant tolerance to cadmium stress. These results indicate that ZmUBP15, ZmUBP16 and ZmUBP19 are required for plant to tolerance the cadmium stress. Consistent with this point, cadmium-related genes are markedly up-regulated in seedlings over-expressing ZmUBP15, ZmUBP16 or ZmUBP19. Furthermore, our data indicate that ZmUBP15, ZmUBP16 and ZmUBP19 partially rescue the salt-stress phenotype of ubp16-1. Thus, our research uncover the functions of three novel maize proteins, ZmUBP15, ZmUBP16 and ZmUBP19, which are required for plants in response to cadmium stress and salt stress.
