Synthesis of lactose lauryl ester in organic solvents using aluminosilicate zeolite as a catalyst.
Sugar-based biosurfactants are safer and healthier alternatives to synthetic surfactants especially for use in the food industry. In this work, biosurfactants were synthesized via the esterification of lactose with lauric acid in different organic solvents without using lipase or other enzymes. Commercial aluminosilicate zeolite was used as a catalyst. Conversions of up to 92% were obtained for pure lactose and 38% for raw lactose from whey. Surface-active properties including surface tension, interfacial tension, and contact angle were measured. All samples showed surface tensions lower than sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS (19.59-36.57 mN/m compared to 38.8 mN/m for SDS) and interfacial tensions comparable with it (9.47-12.18 mN/m compared to 4.77 mN/m for SDS). Results showed that aluminosilicate zeolites can be used for the synthesis of lactose esters, which have potential applications as biosurfactants for the food industry featuring low surface and interfacial tensions.
