PtNi bimetallic nanoparticles loaded MoS2 nanosheets: Preparation and electrochemical sensing application for the detection of dopamine and uric acid.
Composite nanomaterials are particularly useful and offer many excellent opportunities for electrochemical sensing application. Depending on the high catalytic activity of bimetallic nanoparticles, the large specific surface area, abundant active edges and co-catalytic function of MoS2 nanosheets, we, for the first time, prepared a novel PtNi bimetallic nanoparticles loaded MoS2 nanosheets (PtNi@MoS2) hybrid material by a co-reduction method for the electrochemical sensing application. The nanocomposite is characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and then casted on a bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to fabricate an electrochemical sensor (PtNi@MoS2/GCE). The electrochemical investigation showed that the sensor performed good selectivity and wide linear ranges for the simultaneous detection of dopamine (0.5-150 μM) and uric acid (0.5-600 μM). And the detection limits were down to 0.1 μM (S/N = 3) for both analytes.                 Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
