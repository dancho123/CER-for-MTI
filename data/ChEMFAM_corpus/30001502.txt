Inhibition of adenosine deaminase and xanthine oxidase by valproic acid abates hepatic triglyceride accumulation independent of corticosteroids in female rats treated with estrogen-progestin.
Elevated circulating uric acid has been postulated to play an important pathophysiological role in estrogen-progestin combined oral contraceptive (COC)-induced hypertension and endothelial dysfunction. We hypothesized that disruption of glucoregulation and liver triglyceride (TG) accumulation induced by COC use would be abated by valproic acid (VPA) treatment through suppression of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and xanthine oxidase (XO) activities. Female Wistar rats aged 9-10 weeks were treated with a combination of estrogen-progestin COC steroids (1.0 μg ethinylestradiol and 5.0 μg levonorgestrel; p.o.) with or without VPA (100.0 mg/kg; p.o.) daily for 6 weeks. The result shows that the disrupted glucoregulation and associated elevated hepatic ADA activity, plasma and hepatic XO activity, uric acid (UA), TG/HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, and malondialdehyde induced by COC treatment were attenuated by VPA treatment. However, VPA did not have any effect on plasma aldosterone, corticosterone, ADA, circulating and hepatic free fatty acid. Our results demonstrate that suppression of plasma and hepatic XO activities, along with hepatic ADA activity and UA by VPA treatment, protects against disrupted glucoregulation and increased liver TG by COC independent of elevated corticosteroids. The findings imply that VPA would provide protection against the development of cardiometabolic disorder via inhibition of the ADA/XO/UA-mediated pathway.
