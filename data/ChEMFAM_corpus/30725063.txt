[Detection of mutations of the HNF1B gene in children with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract].
Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract are caused by genetic alterations mostly unknown. Mutations in the gene that codes for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1B (HNF1B) are the most frequently described monogenic causes. Data are unknown in Chile and Latin America.                 To determine the presence of variants of the HNF1B gene in Chilean children with conge nital anomalies of the kidney and/or the urinary tract and their clinical characteristics.                 Descriptive study with children aged 10 months to 17 years, patients of the Calvo Mackenna Hospital Nephrology Unit, with cystic renal dysplasia, non cystic renal dysplasia/hypoplasia, horses hoe kidney between April and December 2016. HNF1B variants were determined by sequencing of exons 1, 2, 3 and 4 after DNA extraction and amplification. Restriction enzymes were used to define if the variants were homo or heterozygous. Direct family members of index cases were studied with sequencing of the affected exon.                 32 patients were included, 43.75% males, median age 11 years. 65.6% of them had non-cystic renal dysplasia, 31.25% cystic renal dysplasia, and 3.15% hor seshoe kidney. In two patients (6.25%) the same heterozygous genetic variant was detected in exon 4, position 1027 (C1027T), not previously described. The study of relatives found the same variant in three out of five individuals, all without congenital nephro-urological anomalies.                 We confirmed the presence of a not previously described heterozygous genetic variant of the HNF1B gene. This work initiates the search for this type of mutations in our region which allows us to ap proach the knowledge of causality, determination of extrarenal involvement, and genetic counseling.
