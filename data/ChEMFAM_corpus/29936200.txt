Evaluation of novel formulations of d-β-hydroxybutyrate and melatonin in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock.
d-β-hydroxybutyrate and melatonin (BHB/MLT) infusion improves survival in hemorrhagic shock models. The original BHB/MLT formulation contains dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to increase melatonin solubility. We formulated BHB/MLT solutions wherein DMSO was replaced either with 10% polyvinylpyrrolidone (BHB/MLT/PVP) or with 5% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin/2.5% PVP/2.5% polyethylene glycol 400 (BHB/MLT/CD). Safety and efficacy of the new and the original BHB/MLT solution were tested in a lethal rat hemorrhagic shock model, with seven groups: 1) sham, 2) shock, untreated, 3) shock, lactated Ringer's solution (LR), 4) shock, 4 M BHB/MLT/DMSO, 5) shock, 2 M BHB/MLT/DMSO, 6) shock, BHB/MLT/PVP and 7) shock, BHB/MLT/CD. BHB/MLT/DMSO was given at full strength and 1:1 dilution to match the concentration of the novel formulations. Rats were anesthetized, instrumented, and 40% of the total blood volume was withdrawn in three steps, followed by four-hour long shock. Treatment boluses were infused half-way throughout hemorrhage. Survival was highest in BHB/MLT/CD-treated rats (8/10), followed by the BHB/MLT/PVP (6/10), 4 M BHB/MLT/DMSO (5/10) or 2 M BHB/MLT/DMSO (5/10), LR (3/10) and the untreated group (0/11). Survival did not differ significantly between BHB/MLT groups (p > 0.05), but was significantly higher in BHB/MLT/CD than in LR-treated animals (p = 0.018). BHB/MLT/PVP and BHB/MLT/CD constitute promising candidates for clinical hemorrhagic shock treatment.                 Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
