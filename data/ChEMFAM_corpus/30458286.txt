LncRNAs expression in adriamycin-induced rats reveals the potential role of LncRNAs contributing to chronic glomerulonephritis pathogenesis.
Chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) is the most common form of primary glomerular disease with unclear molecular mechanisms. Currently, limited study on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in CGN is available. Our study aimed to identify potential lncRNAs and genes in the normal and adriamycin-induced CGN rats, which to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of CGN pathogenesis.                 To identify LncRNAs specifically expressed in CGN, the expression of LncRNAs in glomerular tissues of rats from the adriamycin-induced group (n = 3) was compared with that in the control group (n = 3) using RNA-sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Identification of differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were performed between the 2 groups. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to analyze the biological functions and pathways for the differentially expressed mRNAs. LncRNA-mRNA co-expression network was constructed to analyses for the genes. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was visualized.                 A total of 114 significantly up-regulated and 86 down-regulated lncRNAs, 1038 up-regulated and 88 down-regulated mRNAs were identified. Additionally, Il6, with the highest connectivity degree in PPI network, was noteworthy enriched in various kinds pathways. Coding-non-coding gene co-expression networks (CNC network) were drawn based on the correlation analysis between the differentially expressed LncRNAs and mRNAs. Ten LncRNAs, NONRATT000964.2, NONRATT018086.2, NONRATT023684.2, NONRATT009530.2, NONRATT006315.2, NONRATT026805.2, MSTRG.9260.1, NONRATT009155.2, MSTRG.7681.1, NONRATT009275.2, were selected to analyze the relationship between LncRNAs and CGN via the CNC network and GO analysis. Real-time PCR result confirmed that the six LncRNAs were specifically expressed in the CGN rats.                 The ten LncRNAs were differentially expressed and might play important roles in the development of CGN. Key genes, such as Il6, Ptprc, TOP2a, Fos, Myc, etc., may be crucial biomarkers for CGN.                 Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.
