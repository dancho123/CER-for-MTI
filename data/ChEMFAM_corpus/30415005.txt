Inhibition of miR-423-5p suppressed prostate cancer through targeting GRIM-19.
To determine the effect of miR-423-5p on the progression of prostate cancer (PC).                 miR-423-5p and GRIM-19 expressions were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. PC cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. PC cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Dual luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the interaction between miR-423-5p and GRIM-19.                 Compared with normal prostate tissues and prostate epithelial cell HPrEC, miR-423-5p was up-regulated in human PC tissues and PC3 cells, whereas GRIM-19 expression was decreased. Inhibition of miR-423-5p suppressed PC3 cell proliferation, promoted PC3 cell apoptosis, and decreased anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2 expression. GRIM-19 was a target of miR-423-5p, and GRIM-19 was negatively regulated by miR-423-5p in PC3 cells. In addition, miR-423-5p knockdown inhibited the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of PC3 cells through GRIM-19. In vivo experiments showed that miR-423-5p inhibitor administration reduced tumor volume, down-regulated miR-423-5p and GRIM-19 expressions in PC tissues of nude mice.                 Inhibition of miR-423-5p suppressed PC through targeting GRIM-19.                 Copyright Â© 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.
