Root and detritus of transgenic Bt crop did not change nematode abundance and community composition but enhanced trophic connections.
Transgenic Bacillus thuringensis (Bt) crops are widely deployed to control lepidopterous pests with minimal impact on non-target soil invertebrates. However, most of the results were obtained from field works, the great environmental variation may conceal the small spatial-temporal scaled changes in microhabitats, such as those created near the roots (rhizosphere) or around decomposing residues (detritusphere), which are expected to impact free-living soil organisms more than the bulk soils. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of root and straw residues of transgenic crops on soil, by comparing nematode communities in the rhizosphere (soil microsites only affected by living root), the detritusphere (soil microsites affected by crop aboveground residues) and the rhizosphere-detritusphere interface (soil microsites intensively co-affected by root and residues) of Bt rice and its non-Bt near isoline. Bt rice did not affect nematode abundance and community composition, however, it enhanced the network connections within nematode communities, in both the rhizosphere and detritusphere, indicating the frequency of co-occurring species increased due to the moderate stress of crystal (Cry) as a labile resource of protein or as a moderate pressure of toxic compounds. Furthermore, 60-80% of the correlation between Cry protein (Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac) and nematode genera were positive in the rhizosphere and detritusphere of Bt rice, suggesting that higher Cry protein concentration was associated with the intensive co-occurrence among nematode populations. This finding offers new insights into how the biotic interactions of non-target soil community response to both live and dead parts of transgenic crop, highlighting the moderate stress of Cry protein might affect the community structure and consequent functioning of soil ecosystem based on the elaborately developed knowledge of biotic interactions via ecological network analysis.
