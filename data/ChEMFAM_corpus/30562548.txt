Parathyroid hormone-stimulation of Runx2 during osteoblast differentiation via the regulation of lnc-SUPT3H-1:16 (RUNX2-AS1:32) and miR-6797-5p.
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) acts as a regulator of calcium homeostasis and bone remodeling. Runx2, an essential transcription factor in bone, is required for osteoblast differentiation. Noncoding RNAs such as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in regulating gene expression in osteoblasts. In this study, we investigated the effects of PTH on osteoblast differentiation via Runx2, lncRNA, and miRNA expression in human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) and human osteoblastic cells (MG63). PTH-treatment of hBMSCs for 24 h, 7 days, and 14 days stimulated Runx2 mRNA expression. Using bioinformatics tools, we identified 17 lncRNAs originating from human Runx2 gene. Among these, lnc-SUPT3H-1:16 (RUNX2-AS1:32) expression was highly up-regulated by the 7 d PTH-treatment in hBMSCs. We also identified miR-6797-5p as the putative target of lnc-SUPT3H-1:16 and Runx2 using bioinformatics tools. PTH-treatment increased the expression of miR-6797-5p in hBMSCs, and overexpression of miR-6797-5p decreased osteoblast differentiation in MG63 cells, suggesting a role for lnc-SUPT3H-1:16 as sponge molecule. A luciferase gene reporter assay identified direct targeting of miR-6797-5p with lnc-SUPT3H-1:16 and 3'UTR Runx2 in MG63 cells. Thus, PTH stimulated the expression of lnc-SUPT3H-1:16, miR-6797-5p and Runx2, and due to the sponging mechanism of lnc- SUPT3H-1:16 towards miR-6797-5p, Runx2 was protected, resulting in the promotion of osteoblast differentiation.
