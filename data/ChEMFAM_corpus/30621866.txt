Molecular characterization of Listeria monocytogenes isolates from a small-scale meat processor in Montenegro, 2011-2014.
The presence of Listeria monocytogenes was evaluated in a small-scale meat processing facility in Montenegro during 2011-2014. L. monocytogenes isolates from traditional meat products and environmental swabs were subjected to a) molecular characterization b) serotyping by both multiplex PCR and next generation sequencing (NGS) c) potential antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was assessed by extraction of specific genes from NGS data and d) screening for the presence of some disinfectant resistance markers. Overall, traditional meat products were contaminated, most likely from incoming raw materials, with 4 major specific STs of L. monocytogenes (ST515, ST8, ST21, ST121) representing 4 clonal complexes (CC1, CC8, CC21, CC121) identified during the four-year period. These strains belonged to serogroup IIa which predominated, followed by IVb (ST515, CC1). The strains from environmental swabs belonged, exclusively, to ST21 and were isolated from cutting board and floor swabs in 2011. Furthermore, we found Tn6188, a novel transposon conferring tolerance to BC, to be specific to sequence type ST121. In addition, antimicrobial resistance genes mprF and fosX were present in clonal complexes CC21 and CC121, while complexes CC8 and CC1 exclusively harbored the mprF antimicrobial resistance gene.
