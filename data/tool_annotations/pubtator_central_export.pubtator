23566289|t|Serum Soluble-Fas, Inflammation, and Anemia in Acute Kidney Injury.
23566289|a|Anemia is a common feature in critically ill patients. Serum soluble-Fas (sFas) levels are associated with anemia in chronic kidney disease. It is possible that sFas levels are also associated with anemia in acute kidney injury (AKI) patients. The study aims to investigate the relationship between serum levels of sFas, erythropoietin (Epo), inflammatory cytokines, and hemoglobin (Hb) concentration in critically ill patients with AKI. We studied 72 critically ill patients with AKI (AKI group; n = 53) or without AKI (non-AKI group; n = 19), and 18 healthy volunteers. Serum sFas, Epo, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, iron status, and Hb concentration were analyzed in all groups. We also investigated the correlation between these variables in the AKI group. Critically ill patients (AKI and non-AKI groups) had higher serum levels of Epo than healthy volunteers. Hb concentration was lower in the AKI group than in the other groups. Serum sFas, IL-6, TNF-α, and ferritin levels were higher in the AKI group. Hb concentration correlated negatively with serum IL-6 (r = -0.37, P = 0.008), sFas (r = -0.35, P = 0.01), and Epo (r = -0.27, P = 0.04), while serum sFas correlated positively with iron levels (r = 0.36, P = 0.008) and IL-6 (r = 0.28, P = 0.04) in the AKI group. In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for markers of inflammation and iron stores, only serum sFas levels (P = 0.03) correlated negatively with Hb concentration in the AKI group. Serum Epo and inflammatory cytokine levels are elevated in critically ill patients with or without AKI. Serum levels of sFas are elevated and independently associated with anemia in critically ill patients with AKI.

25881691|t|Lessons from 11C-Dihydrotetrabenazine Imaging in a Xenograft Mouse Model of Rat Insulinoma: is PET Imaging of Pancreatic Beta Cell Mass Feasible?
25881691|a|AIM: The feasibility of beta cell mass (BCM) imaging and quantification with positron emission tomography (PET) in the pancreas is controversial. In an effort to shed some light on this topic, we have used a xenograft model of rat insulinoma (RIN) in mice, mimicking an intramuscular islet transplantation situation. METHODS: 105 RIN cells were subcutaneously implanted in nude mice (n=8). Tumour size and glycaemia levels were determined daily. Rat C-peptide was measured to demonstrate rat insulin production. PET imaging with 1 1 C-(+)-α--dihidrotetrabenazine (1 1 C--DTBZ) was done at 3 and 4 weeks and compared with 1 8 F--FDG and 1 8 F-DOPA studies in the same mice. Ex--vivo autoradiography with 1 1 C--DTBZ was carried out in frozen sections of tumours. VMAT2 expression was measured by Western--blot and immunohistochemistry in tumours and RIN cells. RESULTS: Functional rat insulin production in mice was demonstrated by substantial decrease in glycaemia (<50 mg/dL by week 4) and rat C--peptide levels (7.2±2.6ng/mL) similar to those measured in control rats. PET studies showed that tumour imaging with 1 1 C---DTBZ at four (n=8) and five (n=5) weeks was negative; only bigger tumours could be seen with 1 8 F-DOPA. In explanted tumours 1 1 C-DTBZ autoradiography was negative, albeit VMAT2 expression measured by Western--blotand immunohistochemistry was lower than in cultured RIN cells. CONCLUSION: Although insulinomas are fully functional it does not seem feasible to use 11 C--DTBZ for i n vivo measuring of BCM. This might either be due to inherent technical limitations of PET, decrease in VMAT2 expression in the tumours due to unknown reasons, or other biological limiting facts.

26278388|t|Signal Transduction Mechanisms of Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Emerging Role of Lipin-1.
26278388|a|Lipin-1, a mammalian phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP), is a bi-functional molecule involved in various signaling pathways via its function as a PAP enzyme in the triglyceride synthesis pathway and in the nucleus as a transcriptional co-regulator. In the liver, lipin-1 is known to play a vital role in controlling the lipid metabolism and inflammation process at multiple regulatory levels. Alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) is one of the earliest forms of liver injury and approximately 8-20% of patients with simple steatosis can develop into more severe forms of liver injury, including steatohepatitis, fibrosis/cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The signal transduction mechanisms for alcohol-induced detrimental effects in liver involves alteration of complex and multiple signaling pathways largely governed by a central and upstream signaling system, namely, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)-AMP activated kinase (AMPK) axis. Emerging evidence suggests a pivotal role of lipin-1 as a crucial downstream regulator of SIRT1-AMPK signaling system that is likely to be ultimately responsible for development and progression of AFLD. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that ethanol exposure significantly induces lipin-1 gene and protein expression levels in cultured hepatocytes and in the livers of rodents, induces lipin-1-PAP activity, impairs the functional activity of nuclear lipin-1, disrupts lipin-1 mRNA alternative splicing and induces lipin-1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Such impairment in response to ethanol leads to derangement of hepatic lipid metabolism, and excessive production of inflammatory cytokines in the livers of the rodents and human alcoholics. This review summarizes current knowledge about the role of lipin-1 in the pathogenesis of AFLD and its potential signal transduction mechanisms.

26435084|t|Bcl-xL-mediated antioxidant function abrogates the disruption of mitochondrial dynamics induced by LRRK2 inhibition.
26435084|a|We have used the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y overexpressing Bcl-xL (SH-SY5Y/Bcl-xL) to clarify the effects of this mitochondrial protein on the control of mitochondrial dynamics and the autophagic processes which occur after the inhibition of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) with GSK2578215A. In wild type (SH-SY5Y/Neo) cells, GSK2578215A (1nM) caused a disruption of mitochondrial morphology and an imbalance in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) as indicated by an increase in dichlorofluorescein fluorescence and 4-hydroxynonenal. However, SH-SY5Y/Bcl-xL cells under GSK2578215A treatment, unlike the wild type, preserved a high mitochondrial membrane potential and did not exhibit apoptotical chromatins. In contrast to wild type cells, in SH-SY5Y/Bcl-xL cells, GSK2578215A did not induce mitochondrial translocation of neither dynamin related protein-1 nor the proapoptotic protein, Bax. In SH-SY5Y/Neo, but not SH-SY5Y/Bcl-xL cells, mitochondrial fragmentation elicited by GSK2578215A precedes an autophagic response. Furthermore, the overexpression of Bcl-xL protein restores the autophagic flux pathway disrupted by this inhibitor. SH-SY5Y/Neo, but not SH-SY5Y/Bcl-xL cells, responded to LRRK2 inhibition by an increase in the levels of acetylated tubulin, indicating that this was abrogated by Bcl-xL overexpression. This hyperacetylation of tubulin took place earlier than any of the above-mentioned events suggesting that it is involved in the autophagic flux interruption. Pre-treatment with tempol prevented the GSK2578215A-induced mitochondrial fragmentation, autophagy and the rise in acetylated tubulin in SH-SY5Y/Neo cells. Thus, these data support the notion that ROS act as a second messenger connexion between LRRK2 inhibition and these deleterious responses, which are markedly alleviated by the Bcl-xL-mediated ROS generation blockade.

26449525|t|Decreased expression of long non-coding RNA WT1-AS promotes cell proliferation and invasion in gastric cancer.
26449525|a|Tumor recurrence and metastasis remain the major obstacles for the successful treatment of patients diagnosed with gastric cancer. In recent years, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been considered as key regulators of tumor behavior. In this study, we investigated the expression and biological role of a newly-identified cancer-related lncRNA, WT1-AS. We found that WT1-AS expression was significantly down-regulated in tumor tissues compared to matched adjacent non-tumor tissues. The WT1-AS expression level was also associated with tumor size and the clinicopathological stage. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were inhibited, and the proportion of G0/G1 cells increased when WT1-AS was ectopically-expressed in gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of WT1-AS was demonstrated to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Finally, we found that WT1-AS overexpression could decrease ERK protein phosphorylation. Our study indicates that WT1-AS is significantly down-regulated in gastric cancers and may be correlated with tumor progression.

We hypothesized that in addition to these actions, halofuginone directly promotes the cell-cycle events of satellite cells in the mdx and dysf(-/-) mouse models of early-onset Duchenne muscular dystrophy and late-onset dysferlinopathy, respectively. In both models, addition of halofuginone to freshly prepared single gastrocnemius myofibers derived from 6-week-old mice increased BrdU incorporation at as early as 18h of incubation, as well as phospho-histone H3 (PHH3) and MyoD protein expression in the attached satellite cells, while having no apparent effect on myofibers derived from wild-type mice. BrdU incorporation was abolished by an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, suggesting involvement of this pathway in mediating halofuginone's effects on cell-cycle events. In cultures of myofibers and myoblasts isolated from dysf(-/-) mice, halofuginone reduced Bax and induced Bcl2 expression levels and induced Akt phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. Addition of an inhibitor of the phosphinositide-3-kinase/Akt pathway reversed the halofuginone-induced cell survival, suggesting this pathway's involvement in mediating halofuginone's effects on survival. Thus, in addition to its known role in inhibiting fibrosis and inflammation, halofuginone plays a direct role in satellite cell activity and survival in muscular dystrophies, regardless of the mutation. These actions are of the utmost importance for improving muscle pathology and function in muscular dystrophies.

26454209|t|Reconstituted high-density lipoproteins acutely reduce soluble brain Aβ levels in symptomatic APP/PS1 mice.
26454209|a|Many lines of evidence suggest a protective role for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and its major apolipoprotein (apo)A-I in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). HDL/apoA-I particles are produced by the liver and intestine and, in addition to removing excess cholesterol from the body, are increasingly recognized to have vasoprotective functions. Here we tested the ability of reconstituted HDL (rHDL) consisting of human apoA-I reconstituted with soy phosphatidylcholine for its ability to lower amyloid beta (Aβ) levels in symptomatic APP/PS1 mice, a well-characterized preclinical model of amyloidosis. Animals were treated intravenously either with four weekly doses (chronic study) or a single dose of 60mg/kg of rHDL (acute study). The major finding of our acute study is that soluble brain Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were significantly reduced within 24h of a single dose of rHDL. By contrast, no changes were observed in our chronic study with respect to soluble or deposited Aβ levels in animals assessed 7days after the final weekly dose of rHDL, suggesting that beneficial effects diminish as rHDL is cleared from the body. Further, rHDL-treated animals showed no change in amyloid burden, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ levels, neuroinflammation, or endothelial activation in the chronic study, suggesting that the pathology-modifying effects of rHDL may indeed be acute and may be specific to the soluble Aβ pool. That systemic administration of rHDL can acutely modify brain Aβ levels provides support for further investigation of the therapeutic potential of apoA-I-based agents for AD.

26459048|t|GLI2 cell-specific activity is controlled at the level of transcription and RNA processing: Consequences to cancer metastasis.
26459048|a|High activity of GLI family zinc finger protein 2 (GLI2) promotes tumor progression. Removal of the repressor domain at the N terminus (GLI2∆N) by recombinant methods converts GLI2 into a powerful transcriptional activator. However, molecular mechanisms leading to the formation of GLI2∆N activator proteins have not been established. Herein we report for the first time that the functional activities of GLI2 are parted into different protein isoforms by alternative promoter usage, selection of alternative splicing, transcription initiation and termination sites. Functional studies using melanoma cells revealed that transcriptional regulation of GLI2 is TGFbeta-dependent and supports the predominant production of GLI2∆N and C-terminally truncated GLI2 (GLI2∆C) isoforms in cells with high migratory and invasive phenotype. Taken together, these results highlight the role of transcription and RNA processing as major processes in the regulation of GLI2 activity with severe impacts in cancer development.

26499143|t|[Molecular phenotypes of colorectal cancer is critical in clinical individual treatment].
26499143|a|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is not a single disease, but a group of wide spectrum of heterogeneous diseases, and tumors with similar clinicopathological features may react differently to treatments and have diverse prognosis. So complementary risk evaluation, or based on molecular biomarkers to further stratify colorectal cancer beyond TNM staging is necessary. Understanding mechanism of carcinogenesis is good for subtyping colorectal cancer as well as drug development. So far, 3 major pathways are thought to be related to CRC carcinogenesis, chromosome instability, microsatellite instability and CpG island hypermethylation. High throughput profiling enables to study the molecular basis for CRC more comprehensively and systemically. Several studies have defined 3-6 subtypes. Colorectal Cancer Subtype Consortium has made consensus to divide CRC into 5 subtypes based on pool analysis of available profiling data. Further validation is ongoing. There are only a few biomarkers which can be applied in daily practice, including MSI, RAS, BRAF, PI3KCA and HER2.

26499151|t|[Expression of MACC1 protein in colorectal cancer and its relationship with clinicopathological characteristics].
26499151|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of metastasis-associated colon cancer 1 (MACC1) protein in colorectal cancer and its clinical significance. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry method was used to determine the expression of MACC1 protein in colorectal cancer and normal colorectal mucosal tissues (>5 cm distance to cancer tissue). Statistic analysis was performed to investigate the association between clinicopathologic features and MACC1 expression. RESULTS: The positive rate of MACC1 protein in colorectal cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in normal tissues [75%(72/96) vs. 14.6%(14/96), P<0.01, χ(2)=68.43]. Expression of MACC1 protein was associated with TNM staging (P<0.01, χ(2)=16.82) and distant metastasis (P<0.01, χ(2)=10.53), but not with age, gender, tumor size, differentiation degree, invasion depth, and lymph node metastasis(all P>0.05). Positive rate of MACC1 expression increased with the advanced TNM staging. When distant metastasis occurred, high expression of MACC1 protein in cancer tissues was found. During median 13(4 to 21) months of follow-up, 7 patients died, including 6(8.3%, 6/72) with high expression and 1(4.2%, 1/24) with low expression. Distant metastasis occurred in 9 patients, including 7 with high expression and 2 with low expression. Two patients had local relapse, whose MACC1 expressions were both high. CONCLUSION: MACC1 protein is highly expressed in colorectal cancer tissues, which may be associated with the invasion and metastasis of colorectal cancer.

26499152|t|[Expression of NEK-6 in gastric cancer and its clinical significance].
26499152|a|OBJECTIVE: To explore the NEK-6 expression in gastric cancer tissue and its relationship with clinicopathological features. METHODS: Fluorescent quantification PCR and Western blotting were used to examine the NEK-6 expression in 36 samples of fresh gastric cancer tissues and para-cancer gastric mucosal tissues, human gastric cancer cell lines(BGC-823, MKN-28, SGC-7901, MGC-803, HGC-27, AGS), and human normal gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1). Gastric cancer cell lines with the highest expression level were selected to perform the invasion and migration tests, and the effect of down-regulated NEK-6 expression by siRNA transfection on above invasion and migration tests were observed. Meanwhile NEK-6 expression in 94 paraffin samples of gastric cancer tissues was examined by immunohistochemistry and its positivity was compared among different clinicopathologic features. RESULTS: Fluorescent quantification PCR revealed gastric cancer tissues had significantly higher NEK-6 expression than para-cancer tissues(0.002 80±0.001 36 vs. 0.001 91±0.001 48, P<0.05), NEK-6 expression was up-regulated in 31 gastric cancer tissues (86.1%), and human gastric cancer cell lines had significantly higher NEK-6 expression than GES-1 cells, among whom BGC-823 and AGS cell lines were the highest. Invasion and migration tests showed that as compared to negative siRNA control group, ability of invasion and migration in BGC-823 and AGS cells after siRNA transfection was obviously decreased. In 94 paraffin samples, positive expression rate of NEK-6 was 60.6%(57/94), and NEK-6 expression was significantly associated with gastric cancer distant metastasis, lymph nodes metastasis and TNM staging(all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: NEK-6 expression is up-regulated in gastric cancer tissues, which is significantly associated with distant metastasis, lymph nodes metastasis and TNM staging. Down-regulation of NEK-6 expression can inhibit the ability of invasion and migration in gastric cancer cells.

26499153|t|[Expression and proliferative regulation of miR-204 related to mitochondrial transcription factor A in colon cancer].
26499153|a|OBJECTIVE: To screen the microRNAs involved in colon cancer proliferation and to investigate the expression and regulating function of target miRNA in colon cancer. METHODS: Mitochondrial transcription factor A(TFAM), which was proved to be an oncogene to colon cancer in prior study, was used as target gene. The microRNAs involved in colon cancer proliferation were screened with miRWalk 2.0 software. The expression of screened miRNAs was examined in 30 samples of colon cancer tissue, para-cancer tissue, normal colon cell strain, and 3 colon cancer strains (SW480, HT-29, and HCT116) by real-time PCR. MiR-204 presenting lowest expression was selected to further study in SW480 cells. Dual luciferase reporter assays was performed to examine the association of TFAM with miR-204. Anti-miR-204 lentivirus and miR-240 lentivirus were used to down-regulate and up-regulate miR-204 expression respectively. Change of TFAM protein expression in SW480 cells was detected by Western blotting, and change of SW480 cells proliferation was detected by MTT and BrdU assay after lentivirus transfection. RESULTS: After screening, the candidate miRNAs were miR-204, miR-211, miR-214, miR-381 and miR-590-3p. Expressions of miR-204, miR-211, miR-214 and miR-381 were lower, but miR-590-3p expression was higher, in colon cancer tissues than those in para-cancer tissues(all P<0.05). Meanwhile expressions of above 4 miRNAs(miR-204, miR-211, miR-214 and miR-381) were also lower, but miR-590-3p expression was higher as well, in SW480, HT-29 and HCT116 cells compared to normal colon cells(all P<0.05). Among above 4 miRNAs, miR-204 showed the lowest expression in both colon cancer tissues and cell lines. Expression of miR-204 was negatively correlated with TFAM expression in colon cancer tissues(P<0.05). Dual luciferase reporter assays revealed TFAM could be integrated with miR-204 directly, suggesting TFAM as the direct target of miR-204. After up-regulating miR-204 by lentivirus, expression of TFAM decreased and proliferation increased in SW480 cells(all P<0.05). After down-regulating miR-204 by lentivirus, expression of TFAM increased and proliferation decreased in SW480 cells(all P<0.05). CONCLUSION: MiR-204 inhibits TFAM expression and up-regulates the proliferation of colon cancer cells SW480.

26506125|t|S-adenosylhomocysteine induces inflammation through NFkB: A possible role for EZH2 in endothelial cell activation.
26506125|a|S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) can induce endothelial dysfunction and activation, contributing to atherogenesis; however, its role in the activation of the inflammatory mediator NFkB has not been explored. Our aim was to determine the role of NFkB in SAH-induced activation of endothelial cells. Furthermore, we examined whether SAH, as a potent inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases, suppresses the function of EZH2 methyltransferase to contribute to SAH-induced endothelial cell activation. We found that excess SAH increases the expression of adhesion molecules and cytokines in human coronary artery endothelial cells. Importantly, this up-regulation was suppressed in cells expressing a dominant negative form of the NFkB inhibitor, IkB. Moreover, SAH accumulation triggers the activation of both the canonical and non-canonical NFkB pathways, decreases EZH2, and reduces histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation. EZH2 knockdown recapitulated the effects of excess SAH on endothelial activation, i.e., it induced NFkB activation and the subsequent up-regulation of adhesion molecules and cytokines. Our findings suggest that suppression of the epigenetic regulator EZH2 by excess SAH may contribute to NFkB activation and the consequent vascular inflammatory response. These studies unveil new targets of SAH regulation, demonstrating that EZH2 suppression and NFkB activation mediated by SAH accumulation may contribute to its adverse effects in the vasculature.

26616814|t|[Expression of transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in colon cancer tissues and its clinical significance].
26616814|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif(TAZ) in colon cancer tissues and its association with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis of patients. METHODS: The expression of TAZ protein was detected in 56 resected colon cancer tissues and matched tumor-adjacent tissues using immunohistochemistry. The positive expression rate of TAZ was compared between patients with different clinicopathological features. The association between TAZ expression and prognosis was analyzed. RESULTS: Expression of TAZ protein located in the nucleolus. The positive expression rate of TAZ in colon cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in matched tumor-adjacent tissues(73.2% vs. 12.5%, P=0.000). Clinicopathological evaluation suggested that the expression of TAZ protein was associated with tumor size(P=0.009), depth of infiltration(P=0.026), lymph node metastasis (P=0.007) and TNM staging(P=0.004). Colon cancer patients with negative expression of TAZ showed a better 5-year survival as compared with those with positive expression of TAZ (66.7% vs. 22.9%, P=0.0017). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that positive TAZ expression was an independent factor for predicting poor prognosis in colon cancer (HR:3.532, 95% CI: 1.3-9.9, P=0.016). CONCLUSION: The expression of TAZ protein is up-regulated in colon cancer tissues and its high expression is associated with poor prognosis of colon cancer patients.

26634950|t|Preparation of Carboxymethyl Chitosan Microspheres and Their Application in Hemostasis.
26634950|a|OBJECTIVE: Chitosan (CS) is currently used as a hemostatic agent in emergencies and in military settings. However, its application is limited owing to its poor hydrophilia at neutral pH. Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) is an important, water-soluble derivative of CS. In this study, we prepared CS and CMCS microspheres (CSMs and CMCSMs, respectively) and evaluated their hemostatic effect. METHODS: To prepare the microspheres of various sizes, we used the emulsion cross-linking technique. CMCSMs were also loaded with etamsylate (DIC). Clotting time in vitro and in a hepatic injury model was examined to evaluate the hemostatic effect. RESULTS: CMCSMs swelled more and clotted faster than did CSMs. CMCSMs loaded with DIC had no effect on hemostasis. CONCLUSIONS: Both increasing material hydrophilicity and expanding the contact area promoted clotting, whereas chemical cross-linking hampered it because of decreased swelling. CMCSMs are promising candidates for the production of effective hemostatic agents. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2015;0:1-8).

26639231|t|Cathepsin L is involved in proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells.
26639231|a|Cathepsin L(CTSL), a lysosomal endopeptidase was found overexpressed in Breast cancer (BC). The purpose of this work was to investigate the possible role of CTSL in the development of BC. RNA interference(RNAi) with a CTSL small hairpin RNAs(CTSL-shRNA) and plasmid with CTSL were used to identify the effects of CTSL on malignant behaviors of BC. MCF-7 and SKBR-3 were selected as cell models in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that down-regulation of CTSL can significantly inhibit the proliferative and invasive ability of MCF-7 cell, while up-regulation of CTSL in SKBR-3 cells had opposite effects. Comparing to parental BC cells, CTSL knockdown cells exhibited attenuated capacities in developing tumor in nude mice, furthermore, the growth of these xenografts were dramatically regressed. In conclusion, our findings suggest that CTSL contributes to the proliferation and metastasis of BC and might be a potent molecular target for BC treatment.

26639236|t|10-Hydroxycamptothecin induces apoptosis in human neuroblastoma SMS-KCNR cells through p53, cytochrome c and caspase 3 pathways.
26639236|a|Neuroblastoma (NB), the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood, remains one of the most challenging types of cancer to treat. Therefore, the search for novel effective drugs for its treatment is essential. The present study used 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT), which is a naturally occurring alkaloid anticancer agent extracted from the Chinese tree, Camptotheca acuminata, and has a strong anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. HCPT is able to induce apoptosis in cells of various tumor types. However, few studies have been conducted on its efficacy in NB, and its apoptosis-inducing mechanism has not been elucidated. In the present study, the in vitro effects of HCPT on apoptosis in the human NB cell line, SMS-KCNR, and its underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated. Cell proliferation was measured by an MTT assay and apoptosis was measured using DAPI staining and flow cytometric analysis. In addition, western blot analysis was used to evaluate the apoptosis-associated signaling pathways. HCPT was observed to markedly inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in SMS-KCNR cells at a relatively low concentration (2.5-20 nM). DAPI staining revealed typical apoptotic feature, namely apoptotic body formation. The flow cytometric analysis revealed that the number of apoptotic cells increased from 20.89% (for 2.5 nM) to 97.66% (for 20 nM) following HCPT treatment for 48 h. Western blot analysis revealed that p53, cytoplasmic cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) proteins were significantly upregulated, while the mitochondrial cytochrome c and pro-caspase-3 proteins were downregulated. However, the B-cell lymphoma 2 and Bcl-2-associated X proteins were unaffected. The results indicated that HCPT may inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in the SMS-KCNR cells. The possible mechanism of apoptosis induction is the p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway, which promotes cytochrome c release and induces apoptosis by activating caspase-3 and PARP. Our study provides experimental evidence for HCPT as a potent therapeutic drug in NB treatment.

26639240|t|Human papillomavirus and Epstein-Barr virus in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in a non-endemic eastern european population.
26639240|a|Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a rare malignancy in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, with the standardized incidence rate of < 1:100000 person-years. Viral status of NPC in these non-endemic Eastern European regions is currently unknown. In a retrospective study, we evaluated the presence of EBV and HPV in 62 NPC cases. EBV status was determined by the use of in situ hybridization (ISH) for EBV encoded small RNA 1 (EBER1). HPV status was examined with p16 immunohistochemistry, DNA ISH and DNA polymerase chain reaction. Sixty-one studied cases showed non-keratinizing morphology and one was keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Only one NPC with non-keratinizing morphology was scored as p16-positive (nuclear and cytoplasmic staining ≥ 70% of tumor cells). This case was positive for high-risk HPV by ISH and the DNA PCR confirmed the presence of HPV18 type. At the same time, this case was found negative for EBV. Remaining sixty-one cases that were scored as p16-negative were all found HPV-negative by ISH and the DNA PCR. EBV was detected in 85.5% (53/62) of cases and 9 cases were EBV-negative, including the case of keratinizing NPC. In contrast with previous reports on the prevalence of EBV-positivity in Caucasian patients with NPC, the majority of patients coming from this non-endemic region show EBV-positivity; therefore, they may be candidates for novel EBV-targeting therapies. Conversely, HPV-positive NPC is very rare and HPV does not seem to play a significant role in the etiopathogenesis of NPC in these Eastern European populations.

26676538|t|Oxidative stress and renal toxicity after subacute exposure to decabrominated diphenyl ether in Wistar rats.
26676538|a|Fully brominated diphenyl ether (BDE-209) is a flame retardant widely used in plastics and textiles. Because of its high persistence, humans are exposed to it continuously, mainly via dust ingestion. We investigated effects of BDE-209 on renal function and oxidative stress development in the kidney after subacute exposure in rats. Five groups of animals were given by oral gavage 31.25-500 mg BDE-209/kg b.w./day for 28 days, and relative kidney weight, serum urea and creatinine, and oxidative stress parameters in the kidney were determined. Benchmark-dose approach was used for dose response modeling. Serum creatinine was increased, while results obtained for serum urea were inconclusive. Relative kidney weight was not affected by BDE-209. Kidney reduced glutathione was elevated, while superoxide dismutase activity was not changed after BDE-209 treatment. Also, levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were increased and total -SH groups were decreased, which indicated oxidative imbalance. The critical effect dose (CED)/CEDL ratios for the effects on TBARS and total -SH groups indicated estimated CEDs for these markers can be used in risk assessment of BDE-209. Our study results have shown that a relatively low dose of BDE-209 affects kidney function and that oxidative stress is one of the mechanisms of its nephrotoxicity.

26774144|t|H19 serves as a diagnostic biomarker and up-regulation of H19 expression contributes to poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer.
26774144|a|Emerging evidences indicate that dysregulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in cancer tumorigenesis and progression and might be used as diagnosis and prognosis biomarker, or potential therapeutic targets. LncRNA H19 has been reported to be upregulated in diverse human cancers; however, its clinical significance in gastric cancer (GC) remains elusive. Expression levels of H19 in 128 pairs of GC and adjacent normal tissues, GC cell lines and GC juices compared to their corresponding controls were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Kaplan-Meier analysis were constructed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic values. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed using the Cox proportional hazard analysis. H19 expression was remarkably increased in GC tissues and cell lines compared with that in the normal control, and its up-regulation was significantly correlated to invasion depth (P < 0.001), advanced TNM stage (P = 0.002) and regional lymph nodes metastasis (P < 0.001) in GC. H19 levels were robust in differentiating GC tissues from controls [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.697; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) = 0.636-0.752, p<0.01]. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that increased H19 expression contributed to poor overall survival (P = 0.017) and disease-free survival (P = 0.024) of patients. A multivariate survival analysis also indicated that H19 could be an independent prognostic marker. The levels of H19 in gastric juice from gastric patients were signiﬁcantly higher than those from normal subjects (P = 0.034). Furthermore, knockdown of H19 expression by siRNA could inhibit cell migration and invasion in GC cells partly via regulating E-cadherin protein expression. H19 might serve as a promising biomarker for early detection and prognosis prediction of GC.

26774155|t|A two kinase-gene signature model using CDK2 and PAK4 expression predicts poor outcome in non-small cell lung cancers.
26774155|a|Risk classification on the basis of specific genomic features can lead to more precise tailoring of treatment for cancer patients. Kinases are potential therapeutic targets and survival factors, but the predictive prognostic potentials of multi-kinase genes have seldom been investigated. In this study, with publicly available microarray data of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), we identified two kinase genes cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and p21 protein (Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) significantly associated with poor outcome. Then we present a combined gene signature model using CDK2 and PAK4 that can stratify disease poor outcome independently of standard clinical prognostic factors. Next, the predictive robustness of this 2-gene classifier was in silico confirmed in an independent microarray dataset, and experimentally validated in a lung cancer cohort by immunohistochemistry. Therefore, in this study, we demonstrated that the CDK2-PAK4 kinase signature may be a useful prognostic indicator and potential target for NSCLC. We also propose that poor outcome subgroup stratified by this classifier may benefit from the recently developed CDK2 and PAK4 inhibitors.

27158766|t|Toxic Dopamine Metabolite DOPAL Forms an Unexpected Dicatechol Pyrrole Adduct with Lysines of α-Synuclein.
27158766|a|Parkinson's disease has long been known to involve the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the coincidental appearance of Lewy bodies containing oligomerized forms of α-synuclein. The "catecholaldehyde hypothesis" posits a causal link between these two central pathologies mediated by 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), the most toxic dopamine metabolite. Here we determine the structure of the dominant product in reactions between DOPAL and α-synuclein, a dicatechol pyrrole lysine adduct. This novel modification results from the addition of two DOPAL molecules to the Lys sidechain amine through their aldehyde moieties and the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond between their alkyl chains to generate a pyrrole ring. The product is detectable at low concentrations of DOPAL and its discovery should provide a valuable chemical basis for future studies of DOPAL-induced crosslinking of α-synuclein.

A nucleotide triphosphate set of 5-chloro-2'-deoxyuridine, 7-deaza-2'-deoxyadenosine, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine, and 7-deaza-2'deoxyguanosine successfully underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using templates of different lengths (57 or 525mer) and Taq or Vent (exo-) DNA polymerases as catalysts. Furthermore, a fully morphed gene encoding a dihydrofolate reductase was generated by PCR using these fully substituted nucleotides and was shown to transform and confer trimethoprim resistance to E. coli. These results demonstrated that fully modified templates were accurately read by the bacterial replication machinery and provide the first example of a long fully modified DNA molecule being functional in vivo.

27389556|t|CDK8 Expression in Extrauterine Leiomyosarcoma Correlates With Tumor Stage and Progression.
27389556|a|Mediator is a multiprotein complex that acts as a versatile transcription coactivator in eukaryotes. CDK8 kinase complex is a 4-protein subunit of the mediator complex that can act as a transcriptional repressor or coactivator, depending on the specific pathways involved. Although the role of MED12 exon 2 mutations is documented in the pathogenesis of uterine leiomyomas, its role in extrauterine smooth muscle tumorigenesis is less clear. Similarly, there is a paucity of data on the role of CDK8 in extrauterine smooth muscle tumorigenesis and progression. Our study correlates immunohistochemical expression of CDK8 and MED12 with clinical and pathologic parameters in extrauterine leiomyosarcomas. Immunohistochemical expression of CDK8 and MED12 in leiomyosarcomas was correlated with the tumor grade, stage, and the presence of local recurrence or metastasis. MED12 was expressed in the majority of leiomyosarcomas regardless of their stage or grade. CDK8 expression was lost in 1 of 6 pT1 tumors, compared with 9 of 10 pT2 tumors (P=0.0076). When the second group was expanded to include those tumors that did not have a recorded pathologic stage but had local recurrence and distant metastases, the difference in CDK8 expression was also statistically significant. Loss of CDK8 expression by immunohistochemistry is more prevalent in somatic leiomyosarcomas presenting at a higher histopathologic stage, as well as with local and distant recurrence, and can be used to enhance the current predictive parameters.

28005299|t|Polymeric Selectin Ligands Mimicking Complex Carbohydrates: From Selectin Binders to Modifiers of Macrophage Migration.
28005299|a|Novel polymeric cell adhesion inhibitors were developed in which the selectin tetrasaccharide sialyl-Lewis(X) (SLe(X) ) is multivalently presented on a biocompatible poly(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (PHPMA) backbone either alone (P1) or in combination with O-sulfated tyramine side chains (P2). For comparison, corresponding polymeric glycomimetics were prepared in which the crucial "single carbohydrate" substructures fucose, galactose, and sialic acid side chains were randomly linked to the PHPMA backbone (P3 or P4 (O-sulfated tyramine)). All polymers have an identical degree of polymerization, as they are derived from the same precursor polymer. Binding assays to selectins, to activated endothelial cells, and to macrophages show that polyHPMA with SLe(X) is an excellent binder to E-, L-, and P-selectins. However, mimetic P4 can also achieve close to comparable binding affinities in in vitro measurements and surprisingly, it also significantly inhibits the migration of macrophages; this provides new perspectives for the therapy of severe inflammatory diseases.

28029034|t|Conductive Polymer-Coated Carbon Nanotubes To Construct Stretchable and Transparent Electrochemical Sensors.
28029034|a|Carbon nanotube (CNT)-based flexible sensors have been intensively developed for physical sensing. However, great challenges remain in fabricating stretchable CNT films with high electrochemical performance for real-time chemical sensing, due to large sheet resistance of CNT film and further resistance increase caused by separation between each CNT during stretching. Herein, we develop a facile and versatile strategy to construct single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)-based stretchable and transparent electrochemical sensors, by coating and binding each SWNT with conductive polymer. As a polymer with high conductivity, good electrochemical activity, and biocompatibility, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) acting as a superior conductive coating and binder reduces contact resistance and greatly improves the electrochemical performance of SWNTs film. Furthermore, PEDOT protects the SWNTs junctions from separation during stretching, which endows the sensor with highly mechanical compliance and excellent electrochemical performance during big deformation. These unique features allow real-time monitoring of biochemical signals from mechanically stretched cells. This work represents an important step toward construction of a high performance CNTs-based stretchable electrochemical sensor, therefore broadening the way for stretchable sensors in a diversity of biomedical applications.

This compound and its non-S-oxygenated congener were fully characterized, and their electronic structures were elucidated in a combined experimental and theoretical study with emphasis on the bridging sulfenato moiety.

28588210|t|Curing the Toxicity of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes through Native Small-molecule Drugs.
28588210|a|With the development and application of nanotechnology, large amounts of nanoparticles will be potentially released to the environment and possibly cause many severe health problems. Although the toxicity of nanoparticles has been investigated, prevention and treatment of damages caused by nanoparticles have been rarely studied. Therefore, isotope tracing and improved CT imaging techniques were used to investigate the biodistribution influence between oMWCNTs(oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)/or simvastatin (TD) in vivo. What's more, biochemical indices in plasma and tissue histology were measured to further study therapeutic effects on the damages of oMWCNTs in mice. Isotope tracing and improved CT imaging results showed that low dosages of DOPC and TD didn't affect the distribution of oMWCNTs in mice; conversely, the distribution and metabolism of DOPC and TD were influenced by oMWCNTs. Moreover, DOPC and/or TD improved the biocompatibility of oMWCNTs in erythrocyte suspension in vitro. Biochemical index and histopathological results indicated that DOPC and TD didn't prevent injuries caused by oMWCNTs effectively. But TD showed a good therapeutic effect for damages. This study is the first to investigate prevention and treatment effects of drugs on damages caused by oMWCNTs and provides new insights and breakthroughs for management of nanoparticles on health hazards.

28588231|t|Genome-wide association study of 1,5-anhydroglucitol identifies novel genetic loci linked to glucose metabolism.
28588231|a|1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) is a biomarker of hyperglycemic excursions associated with diabetic complications. Because of its structural similarity to glucose, genetic studies of 1,5-AG can deliver complementary insights into glucose metabolism. We conducted genome-wide association studies of serum 1,5-AG concentrations in 7,550 European ancestry (EA) and 2,030 African American participants (AA) free of diagnosed diabetes from the ARIC Study. Seven loci in/near EFNA1/SLC50A1, MCM6/LCT, SI, MGAM, MGAM2, SLC5A10, and SLC5A1 showed genome-wide significant associations (P < 5 × 10(-8)) among EA participants, five of which were novel. Six of the seven loci were successfully replicated in 8,790 independent EA individuals, and MCM6/LCT and SLC5A10 were also associated among AA. Most of 1,5-AG-associated index SNPs were not associated with the clinical glycemic markers fasting glucose or the  HbA1c, and vice versa. Only the index variant in SLC5A1 showed a significant association with fasting glucose in the expected opposing direction. Products of genes in all 1,5-AG-associated loci have known roles in carbohydrate digestion and enteral or renal glucose transport, suggesting that genetic variants associated with 1,5-AG influence its concentration via effects on glucose metabolism and handling.

28588270|t|Maternal-placental-fetal biodistribution of multimodal polymeric nanoparticles in a pregnant rat model in mid and late gestation.
28588270|a|Multimodal polymeric nanoparticles have many exciting diagnostic and therapeutic applications, yet their uptake and passage by the placenta, and applications in the treatment of pregnancy complications have not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, the maternal-fetal-placental biodistribution of anionic and cationic multimodal poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) nanoparticles in pregnant rats at mid (ED10) and late (ED20) gestation was examined. Fluorescently-labelled and superparamagnetic PGMA nanoparticles functionalized with/without poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) were administered to pregnant rats at a clinically-relevant dose and biodistribution and tissue uptake assessed. Quantitative measurement of fluorescence intensity or magnetic resonance relaxometry in tissue homogenates lacked the sensitivity to quantify tissue uptake. Confocal microscopy, however, identified uptake by maternal organs and the decidua (ectoplacental cone) and trophoblast giant cells of conceptuses at ED10. At ED20, preferential accumulation of cationic vs. anionic nanoparticles was observed in the placenta, with PGMA-PEI nanoparticles localised mainly within the chorionic plate. These findings highlight the significant impact of surface charge and gestational age in the biodistribution of nanoparticles in pregnancy, and demonstrate the importance of using highly sensitive measurement techniques to evaluate nanomaterial biodistribution and maternal-fetal exposure.

28590721|a|Exploring novel and versatile nanomaterials for the construction of personalized multifunctional phototheranostics with significant potentials in bioimaging-guided tumor phototherapies has attracted considerable attention. Herein, the phototheranostic agent human serum albumin-iron (II) phthalocyanine FePc nanoparticles (HSA-FePc NPs) were fabricated for photoacoustic (PA) imaging-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) of cancer in vivo. The prepared HSA-FePc NPs exhibited high stability, efficient NIR absorption, good capability and stability of photothermal behavior with a high photothermal conversion efficiency of ∼44.4%, high contrast and spatial resolution of PA imaging, efficient cancer therapy, and low long-term toxicity. This potent multifunctional phototheranostic is, therefore, very promising and favorable for effective, precise, and safe antitumor treatment in clinical application.

28590728|t|Switchable Chiral Selection of Aspartic Acids by Dynamic States of Brushite.
28590728|a|We herein show the chiral recognition and separation of aspartic acid (Asp) enantiomers by achiral brushite due to the asymmetries of their dynamical steps in its nonequilibrium states. Growing brushite has a higher adsorption affinity to d-Asp, while l-Asp is predominant on the dissolving brushite surface. Microstructural characterization reveals that chiral selection is mainly attributed to brushite [101] steps, which exhibit two different configurations during crystal growth and dissolution, respectively, with each preferring a distinct enantiomer due to this asymmetry. Because these transition step configurations have different stabilities, they subsequently result in asymmetric adsorption. By varying free energy barriers through solution thermodynamic driving force (i.e., supersaturation), the dominant nonequilibrium intermediate states can be switched and chiral selection regulated. This finding highlights that the dynamic steps can be vital for chiral selection, which may provide a potential pathway for chirality generation through the dynamic nature.

28594000|t|Synthesis and preliminary PET imaging of (11)C and (18)F isotopologues of the ROS1/ALK inhibitor lorlatinib.
28594000|a|Lorlatinib (PF-06463922) is a next-generation small-molecule inhibitor of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinase c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1), which has a kinase domain that is physiologically related to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and is undergoing Phase I/II clinical trial investigations for non-small cell lung cancers. An early goal is to measure the concentrations of this drug in brain tumour lesions of lung cancer patients, as penetration of the blood-brain barrier is important for optimal therapeutic outcomes. Here we prepare both (11)C- and (18)F-isotopologues of lorlatinib to determine the biodistribution and whole-body dosimetry assessments by positron emission tomography (PET). Non-traditional radiolabelling strategies are employed to enable an automated multistep (11)C-labelling process and an iodonium ylide-based radiofluorination. Carbon-11-labelled lorlatinib is routinely prepared with good radiochemical yields and shows reasonable tumour uptake in rodents. PET imaging in non-human primates confirms that this radiotracer has high brain permeability.

28606865|t|Use of growth hormone, IGF-I, and insulin for anabolic purpose: Pharmacological basis, methods of detection, and adverse effects.
28606865|a|Hormones with anabolic properties such as growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I), and insulin are commonly abused among professional and recreational athletes to enhance physical ability. Performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) such as these are also commonly used by recreational athletes to improve body aesthetics. The perception of increased muscle mass due to supraphysiologic hormone supplementation, or doping, is widespread among PED users despite a paucity of evidence-based data in humans. Even still, athletes will continue to abuse PEDs in hopes of replicating anecdotal results. It is important to educate the general public and potential treating physicians of the risks of PED use, including the dangers of polypharmacy and substance dependence. It will also be important for the research community to address the common challenges associated with studying PED use such as the ethical considerations of PED administration, the general reticence of the PED-using community to volunteer information, and the constant need to improve or create new detection methods as athletes continually attempt to circumvent current methods. This review highlights the anabolic mechanisms and suggestive data implicating GH, IGF-I, and insulin for use as PEDs, the specific detection methods with cutoff ranges that may be utilized to diagnose abuse of each substance, and their respective side effects.

28611362|t|Zinc-modified Calcium Silicate Coatings Promote Osteogenic Differentiation through TGF-β/Smad Pathway and Osseointegration in Osteopenic Rabbits.
28611362|a|Surface-modified metal implants incorporating different ions have been employed in the biomedical field as bioactive dental implants with good osseointegration properties. However, the molecular mechanism through which surface coatings exert the biological activity is not fully understood, and the effects have been difficult to achieve, especially in the osteopenic bone. In this study, We examined the effect of zinc-modified calcium silicate coatings with two different Zn contents to induce osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow-derived pericytes (BM-PCs) and osteogenetic efficiency in ovariectomised rabbits. Ti-6Al-4V with zinc-modified calcium silicate coatings not only enhanced proliferation but also promoted osteogenic differentiation and mineralized matrix deposition of rat BM-PCs as the zinc content and culture time increased in vitro. The associated molecular mechanisms were investigated by Q-PCR and Western blotting, revealing that TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway plays a direct and significant role in regulating BM-PCs osteoblastic differentiation on Zn-modified coatings. Furthermore, in vivo results that revealed Zn-modified calcium silicate coatings significantly promoted new bone formation around the implant surface in osteopenic rabbits as the Zn content and exposure time increased. Therefore, Zn-modified calcium silicate coatings can improve implant osseointegration in the condition of osteopenia, which may be beneficial for patients suffering from osteoporosis-related fractures.

28691448|t|Evaluation of chemical-physical properties and cytocompatibility of TheraCal LC.
28691448|a|TheraCal LC (TLC, Bisco Inc., Schaumburg, IL, USA) is a light-cured, resin-modified, calcium silicate-filled base/liner material designed for direct and indirect pulp-capping. In this study the result of the evaluation in vitro of the biocompatibility and chemical-physical properties of TLC are reported. TLC specimens were prepared under aseptic conditions in strict compliance with the manufacturers instructions and sterilized. Osteoblast-like cells (MG63) were used. For different time points, solubility, water uptake, alkalinizing activity and cytotoxicity were evaluated. In ddH20 and in DMEM+FBS, TLC showed a loss of material increasing simultaneously with the absorption capacity. The increase of water uptake of the material promoting the solubilization of mineral ions in medium is a requisite for a bioactive material. The alkalinizing activity is correlated to antimicrobial/bacteriostatic activity and to the ability to favor the formation of apatite deposits. The pH values for water absorption after immersion of the disks ranged between 8 and 9 at each times of evaluation. Cytotoxicity was not observed in MG63 cells treated with TLC and after 5 days, the cells were organized to form a confluent monolayer as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy observation. TLC showed biocompatibility on MG63 cells allowing a physiologic cell growth and differentiation. The chemical-physical properties and biocompatibility of TLC observed in vitro in the present study, allows considering this cement as an innovative pulp-capping material for the vital pulp therapy.

28965682|t|Effect of brushing and thermocycling on the shade and surface roughness of CAD-CAM ceramic restorations.
28965682|a|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The effects of toothbrushing (B) and thermocycling (TC) on the surface texture of different materials with various fabrication processes have been investigated. However, studies of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) ceramic restorations are limited. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of B and TC on the color stability and surface roughness of extrinsically characterized and glazed CAD-CAM ceramic restorations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Lithium disilicate CAD ceramic (n=90) and zirconia ceramic (n=90) were studied. All specimens were crystallized/sintered, characterized, and glazed following the manufacturer's recommendation. The specimens were divided into 9 different groups: B, TC, and a combination of B plus TC (B+TC). Brushing was performed at 50 000, 100 000, and 150 000 cycles, simulating an oral environment of 5, 10, and 15 years. Thermocycling was performed at 6000, 12 000, and 18 000 cycles, simulating an oral environment of 5, 10, and 15 years. Brushing plus TC was performed with the combination of the 50 000 cycles of B, then 6000 cycles of TC, and 10 000 cycles of B, then 12 000 cycles of TC, and 15 000 cycles of B, then 18 000 cycles of TC. The color and surface roughness of each specimen were measured before and after all interventions with simulated cycles. Color differences (ΔE) and surface roughness (ΔRa) data were analyzed using 2-way ANOVA, followed by the least significant difference test (α=.05). The correlation between ΔE and ΔRa was statistically analyzed using the Pearson correlation analysis. RESULTS: Within the lithium disilicate CAD groups, intervention did not result in any significant differences in color change (P>.05). Within the zirconia groups, a 15-year clinical simulation revealed significantly higher ΔE values than a simulated 5-year exposure (P=.017). Increased simulated cycles showed significantly higher Ra values for all groups. Within the zirconia groups, B revealed significantly smoother surfaces than TC (P<.001) and B+TC interventions (P<.001). For the zirconia, simulating B+TC for15 years revealed significantly higher Ra values than the groups of B+TC for 5 years (P<.001) and B+TC for 10 years (P=.003). No correlation (lithium disilicate CAD, r=.079; P=.462; zirconia, r=.001; P=.989) was found between the color change and surface roughness. CONCLUSIONS: For both lithium disilicate CAD and zirconia, color changes were below the selected clinical perceptible threshold (ΔE=2.6) after all intervention and simulated cycles. All mean surface roughness measurements were below 0.2 μm. Generally, the surface of both lithium disilicate CAD and zirconia became rougher. No correlation was found between color difference and surface roughness for either material.

29077529|t|Postnatal melatonin treatment protects against affective disorders induced by early life immune stimulation by reducing the microglia cell activation and oxidative stress.
29077529|a|Systemic inflammation induced by neonatal infection may result as long-term hyperactivation of microglial cells followed by an overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), nitric oxide (NO), and lipid peroxidation. Those inflammation mediators can trigger behavioral disruption and/or cognitive disorders. The present work aims to evaluate the effect of melatonin (a cytokine release modulator and antioxidant agent) in the reduction of the prefrontal microglia activation and depressive-like behaviors induced by LPS injection in adult rats. The effect of melatonin (5 mg/kg) was compared to minocycline (50 mg/kg), a well-known anti-inflammatory drug with potent inhibitory effect on microglial activation. Our results showed that LPS injection induced a significant increase in prefrontal cortex TNF-α and NO levels. Furthermore, lipid peroxidation and microglial activation were highly increased in the prefrontal cortex compared to control. The melatonin treatment induced a significant decrease on NO and lipid peroxidation levels in the prefrontal cortex and significant decrease on TNF-α and microglia activation. Melatonin can also induce produced a significant reduction in the anxiety and depression like effect induced by PND9 LPS administration. Our results demonstrated that melatonin possesses potent protective effect against the depression and anxiety induced by LPS. The underlying effect of melatonin is probably due to the reduction of NO toxic effect and lipid peroxidation in addition to its anti-inflammatory effect.

29190205|t|Hypertension regulating angiotensin peptides in the pathobiology of cardiovascular disease.
29190205|a|Renin angiotensin system (RAS) is an endogenous hormone system involved in the control of blood pressure and fluid volume. Dysregulation of RAS has a pathological role in causing cardiovascular diseases through hypertension. Among several key components of RAS, angiotensin peptides, varying in amino acid length and biological function, have important roles in preventing or promoting hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, vascular remodeling etc. These peptides are generated by the metabolism of inactive angiotensinogen or its derived peptides by hydrolyzing action of certain enzymes. Angiotensin II, angiotensin (1-12), angiotensin A and angiotensin III bind primarily to angiotensin II type 1 receptor and cause vasoconstriction, accumulation of inflammatory markers to sub-endothelial region of blood vessels and activate smooth muscle cell proliferation. Moreover, when bound to angiotensin II type 2 receptor, angiotensin II works as cardio-protective peptide and halt pathological cell signals. Other peptides like angiotensin (1-9), angiotensin (1-7), alamandine and angiotensin IV also help in protecting from cardiovascular diseases by binding to their respective receptors.

29210643|t|Adipokines and Myokines: A Pivotal Role in Metabolic and Cardiovascular Disorders.
29210643|a|Obesity induces an imbalance in the expression and secretion of several cytokines, which contributes to the development of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. On the contrary, skeletal muscle is known to have a role in reversing the detrimental impact of obesity. It has been established that adipose tissue acts as an endocrine organ that secretes proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory adipokines. Similarly, skeletal muscle produces secretory molecules, called myokines, from contracting muscle fibers. Myokines were recently recognized as beneficial modulators of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, adipokines and myokines play a crucial role in the communication between adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and other organs. It could be beneficial to find novel adipokines and myokines, and to explore their signaling pathways to identify targets for the treatment and prevention of cardiometabolic disorders. In this review, we summarize recent studies on cross-talk between skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. In particular, we concentrate on the major action mechanisms of adipokines and myokines, such as adiponectin, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein, C1q/TNF-related proteins, interleukin-6, irisin, and fibroblast growth factor 21.

29452802|t|Moving to human trials for argon neuroprotection in neurological injury: a narrative review.
29452802|a|Despite the global burden of brain injury, neuroprotective agents remain elusive. There are no clinically effective therapies which reduce mortality or improve long-term cognitive outcome. Ventilation could be an easily modifiable variable in resuscitation; gases are relatively simple to administer. Xenon is the prototypic agent of a new generation of experimental treatments which show promise. However, use is hindered by its prohibitive cost and anaesthetic properties. Argon is an attractive option, being cheaper, easy to transport, non-sedating, and mechanistically distinct from xenon. In vitro and in vivo models provide evidence of argon reducing brain injury, with improvements in neurocognitive, histological, and biomarker metrics, as well as improved survival. Current data suggest that the effect of argon is mediated via the toll-like receptors 2 and 4, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI-3K)-AKT pathways. Ventilation with argon appears to be safe in pigs and preliminary human trials. Given recent evidence that arterial hyperoxia may be harmful, the supplementation of high-concentration argon may not necessitate changes to clinical practice. Given the logistic benefits, and the evidence for argon neuroprotection summarized in this manuscript, we believe that the time has come to consider developing Phase II clinical trials to assess its benefit in acute neurological injury.

29473709|t|Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin as add-on therapy to a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A 52-week, open-label, phase IV study.
29473709|a|Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are antihyperglycaemic agents with weight-lowering effects. The efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin as add-on therapy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and inadequate glycaemic control with a GLP-1RA (&gt;=12 weeks) were evaluated in this phase IV study. Patients received canagliflozin 100 mg once daily for 52 weeks. Efficacy endpoints included change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and HDL cholesterol from baseline to week 52. Safety endpoints included adverse events (AEs), hypoglycaemia and laboratory tests. Of the 71 patients treated with canagliflozin, 63 completed the study. At 52 weeks, HbA1c was significantly reduced from baseline (-0.70%; paired t test, P &lt; .001). Significant changes were also observed in FPG (-34.7 mg/dL), body weight (-4.46%), SBP (-7.90 mm Hg), and HDL cholesterol (7.60%; all P &lt; .001). The incidence of AEs, adverse drug reactions and hypoglycaemia was 71.8%, 32.4% and 9.9%, respectively. All hypoglycaemic events were mild. These findings suggest that the long-term combination of canagliflozin with a GLP-1RA is effective and well tolerated in Japanese patients with T2DM.

29687582|t|Effect of annealing temperature and dopant concentration on the thermoluminescence sensitivity in LiF:Mg,Cu,Ag material.
29687582|a|LiF:Mg,Cu,Ag is a new dosimetry material that is similar to LiF:Mg,Cu,P in terms of dosimetric properties. The effect of the annealing temperature in the range of 200 to 350 C on the thermoluminescence (TL) sensitivity and the glow curve structure of this material at different concentrations of silver (Ag) was investigated. It has been demonstrated that the optimum values of the annealing temperature and the Ag concentration are 240 C and 0.1 mol% for better sensitivity, respectively. The TL intensity decreases at annealing temperatures lower than 240 C or higher than 240 C, reaching a minimum at 300 C and then again increases for various Ag concentrations. It was observed that the glow curve structure altered and the area under the low temperature peak as well as the area under the main dosimetric peak decreased with increasing annealing temperature. The position of the main dosimetric peak moved in the direction of higher temperatures, but at 320 and 350 C annealing temperatures, it shifted to lower temperatures. It was also observed that the TL sensitivity could partially be recovered by a combined annealing procedure.

29699594|t|Beneficial effects of curcumin and capsaicin on cyclophosphamide-induced premature ovarian failure in a rat model.
29699594|a|BACKGROUND: In recent years, cancer rates have been rising among reproductive-age women. Thus, chemotherapy exposure has become an important cause of premature ovarian failure (POF). There has been growing interest regarding the preservation and restoration of ovarian function before and after oncological treatment because of the reproductive risk of chemotherapeutics and improved long-term survival of cancer patients. In this study, we sought to analyze the effects of curcumin (CRC) and capsaicin (CPS) on cyclophosphamide-induced POF in a rat model. METHODS: POF in rats was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide on day 1 and then 8 mg/kg/day for the following 14 days. After 14 days of cyclophosphamide administration, rats were randomly divided into three groups as follows (n = 10/group): POF, POF + CRC (100 mg/kg/day), and POF + CPS (0.5 mg/kg/day) to determine the effects of CRC and CPS on the cyclophosphamide-induced POF rat model. Biochemical, hormonal, and histopathological evaluations were performed on blood and tissue samples 14 days after the CRC and CPS treatments. RESULTS: Malonaldehyde levels were significantly reduced, and glutathione levels and superoxide dismutase activity were significantly increased, in ovarian tissues in the POF + CRC and POF + CPS groups compared with the POF group. In the POF group, we observed hemorrhage and prominent mononuclear cell infiltration beneath the germinative epithelium, vascular congestion in ovarian stroma, hemorrhage around the corpus luteum, and atresia in ovarian follicles. This histopathological damage was significantly improved by treatment with CRC and CPS. There was a significant reduction in serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels in rats treated with CRC and CPS compared with the POF group. Moreover, the levels of estradiol and anti-mullerian hormone in rats treated with CRC and CPS were significantly increased compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, CRC and CPS treatment of rats with cyclophosphamide-induced POF had a beneficial effect on reducing ovarian damage by improving tissue oxidative stress marker levels, ovarian reserve marker levels, and histopathological parameters. The significant improvements in ovarian tissue histopathological damage and hormonal levels detected in this study indicate that treatment with CRC or CPS might be a conservative treatment approach for cyclophosphamide-induced POF.

29936200|t|Evaluation of novel formulations of d-beta-hydroxybutyrate and melatonin in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock.
29936200|a|d-beta-hydroxybutyrate and melatonin (BHB/MLT) infusion improves survival in hemorrhagic shock models. The original BHB/MLT formulation contains dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to increase melatonin solubility. We formulated BHB/MLT solutions wherein DMSO was replaced either with 10% polyvinylpyrrolidone (BHB/MLT/PVP) or with 5% hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin/2.5% PVP/2.5% polyethylene glycol 400 (BHB/MLT/CD). Safety and efficacy of the new and the original BHB/MLT solution were tested in a lethal rat hemorrhagic shock model, with seven groups: 1) sham, 2) shock, untreated, 3) shock, lactated Ringer's solution (LR), 4) shock, 4 M BHB/MLT/DMSO, 5) shock, 2 M BHB/MLT/DMSO, 6) shock, BHB/MLT/PVP and 7) shock, BHB/MLT/CD. BHB/MLT/DMSO was given at full strength and 1:1 dilution to match the concentration of the novel formulations. Rats were anesthetized, instrumented, and 40% of the total blood volume was withdrawn in three steps, followed by four-hour long shock. Treatment boluses were infused half-way throughout hemorrhage. Survival was highest in BHB/MLT/CD-treated rats (8/10), followed by the BHB/MLT/PVP (6/10), 4 M BHB/MLT/DMSO (5/10) or 2 M BHB/MLT/DMSO (5/10), LR (3/10) and the untreated group (0/11). Survival did not differ significantly between BHB/MLT groups (p &gt; 0.05), but was significantly higher in BHB/MLT/CD than in LR-treated animals (p = 0.018). BHB/MLT/PVP and BHB/MLT/CD constitute promising candidates for clinical hemorrhagic shock treatment.

30001502|t|Inhibition of adenosine deaminase and xanthine oxidase by valproic acid abates hepatic triglyceride accumulation independent of corticosteroids in female rats treated with estrogen-progestin.
30001502|a|Elevated circulating uric acid has been postulated to play an important pathophysiological role in estrogen-progestin combined oral contraceptive (COC)-induced hypertension and endothelial dysfunction. We hypothesized that disruption of glucoregulation and liver triglyceride (TG) accumulation induced by COC use would be abated by valproic acid (VPA) treatment through suppression of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and xanthine oxidase (XO) activities. Female Wistar rats aged 9-10 weeks were treated with a combination of estrogen-progestin COC steroids (1.0 mug ethinylestradiol and 5.0 mug levonorgestrel; p.o.) with or without VPA (100.0 mg/kg; p.o.) daily for 6 weeks. The result shows that the disrupted glucoregulation and associated elevated hepatic ADA activity, plasma and hepatic XO activity, uric acid (UA), TG/HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, and malondialdehyde induced by COC treatment were attenuated by VPA treatment. However, VPA did not have any effect on plasma aldosterone, corticosterone, ADA, circulating and hepatic free fatty acid. Our results demonstrate that suppression of plasma and hepatic XO activities, along with hepatic ADA activity and UA by VPA treatment, protects against disrupted glucoregulation and increased liver TG by COC independent of elevated corticosteroids. The findings imply that VPA would provide protection against the development of cardiometabolic disorder via inhibition of the ADA/XO/UA-mediated pathway.

30002372|t|Ratiometric nanothermometer in vivo based on triplet sensitized upconversion.
30002372|a|Temperature is an essential factor that counts for living systems where complicated vital activities are usually temperature dependent. In vivo temperature mapping based on non-contact optical approach will be beneficial for revealing the physiological phenomena behind with minimized influence to the organism. Herein, a highly thermal-sensitive upconversion system based on triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) mechanism is pioneered to indicate body temperature variation sensitively over the physiological temperature range. The temperature-insensitive NaYF4: Nd nanophosphors with NIR emission was incorporated into the temperature-responsive TTA-upconversion system to serve as an internal calibration unit. Consequently, a ratiometric thermometer capable of accurately monitoring the temperature changes in vivo was developed with high thermal sensitivity (~7.1% K-1) and resolution (~0.1 K).

30010491|t|Oxidative stress, antioxidant capacity, biomolecule damage, and inflammation symptoms of sickle cell disease in children.
30010491|a|BACKGROUND: The phenotypic expression of sickle cell disease (SCD) is a complex pathophysiologic condition. However, sickle erythrocytes might be the cause for multiple sources of pro-oxidant processes with consequent linked to chronic and systemic oxidative stress. Herein, we explored the SCD phenomena could be the result in formation of oxidative stress as well as inflammation in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood samples of 147 SCD subjects were evaluated. A control group was formed of 156 individuals without SCD. Different oxidative stress markers and inflammatory mediators were measured by using various biochemical techniques. Plasma samples were collected from blood for the measurement of antioxidants and reactive oxygen species (ROS). RESULTS: The levels of plasma hydroxyl radical (HO ), and nitric oxide (NO) production were higher in SCD children in compared to control groups. The plasma antioxidants capacities such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and protein thiol levels were significantly reduced in SCD children. The plasma lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, DNA damage markers were significantly altered in different age groups of SCD children. Further, our results showed that SCD children have chronic inflammatory disease due to persistent alteration of haemoglobin content, reticulocyte, total bilirubin, platelet, creatinine, leukocytes, and altered expression of inflammatory mediators in compared to control groups. CONCLUSION: SCD children have high oxidative stress, and conversely, decreased antioxidant activity. Decrease in antioxidant activity might explained the reduction in lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation and increased inflammation, which in turn intensify the symptoms of SCD in children.

30017992|t|Spinocerebellar ataxia 27 with a novel nonsense variant (Lys177X) in FGF14.
30017992|a|Spinocerebellar ataxia 27 (SCA27) is an autosomal dominant SCA caused by variants in the fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) gene. We examined a Japanese SCA patient whose deceased father also suffered from SCA. The patient was a 63-year-old male. He graduated from junior high school but received no further education. The predominant complaint was slowly progressive dysarthria and gait disturbance, which appeared at age 47. He showed pathological saccadic dysmetria, saccadic intrusions into smooth pursuit eye movements, dysarthria, and limb and truncal ataxia. His gait was wide-based but he did not require a walking stick. Limb muscle strength was intact. Deep tendon reflexes were normal or slightly reduced. Pathological reflexes were absent. He demonstrated mildly impaired vibration sense in the lower limbs. There was no urinary dysfunction. Brain MRI showed cerebellar atrophy without brainstem involvement. We first confirmed the absence of repeat expansion in genes known to be responsible for SCAs 1-3, 6-8, 10, 12, 17, 36 and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. By exome analysis, we identified a novel heterozygous variant (NM_004115, c.529A&gt;T; Lys177X) in exon 4 of the FGF14 gene. This variant is expected to generate a truncated FGF14 protein lacking the heparin binding sites, those are likely to modify the activity of FGF14. We confirmed the absence of the variant in 502 healthy Japanese individuals by Sanger sequencing. There is no record of the variant in public databases. We conclude that the novel variation in FGF14 is causative for SCA27 in this patient.

30024839|t|The influence of MTHFR genetic polymorphisms on adverse reactions after methotrexate in patients with hematological malignancies: a meta-analysis.
30024839|a|OBJECTIVES: The effect of methotrexate (MTX)-related adverse reaction on hematologic neoplasms patients is controversial. We performed this meta-analysis to assess the association between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T/A1298C polymorphism and the adverse reaction after MTX using. METHODS: We searched for qualified studies according to PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science. The meta-analysis was performed by Review Manager 5.3. The analysis was conducted to compare risk ratios (RRs) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) to evaluate the relationship between different toxicity reactions and the genotype of MTHFR. RESULTS: We included 17 studies which satisfied with the criteria in this meta-analysis. The results of our statistical analysis showed that no significant correlation between MTHFR C677T/A1298C genetic polymorphism and patients' toxicity or the relapse and survival associated with MTX chemotherapy (P &gt; .05). But we observed that a tendency toward increased risk of hepatotoxicity was also present for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the mutation model (CT/TT vs. CC: RR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.01-3.67; P = .05). CONCLUSION: The polymorphism of MTHFR C677T/A1298C may not be an important indicator for the accurate detection of side effects of chemotherapy after using MTX. More relative research is needed.

30068241|t|miR-29b inhibits the progression of multiple myeloma through downregulating FOXP1.
30068241|a|BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence has suggested that miR-29b plays an antitumor effect in multiple malignancies via the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration. In the present study, we aimed to explore the underlying function and mechanism of miR-29b in multiple myeloma (MM). METHODS: The expression of miR-29b in MM cell lines and tissues was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). CCK-8 and flow cytometry analyses were performed to assess cell proliferation, cycles and apoptosis. Bioinformatics, Dual-Luciferase reporter and qRT-PCR assays were employed to explore the possible correlation between miR-29b and FOXP1. Xenograft model was established to confirm the role of miR-29b on tumor growth in vivo. RESULTS: miR-29b expression was markedly decreased in MM cell lines and tissues and downregulated miR-29b was closely related to International Staging System (ISS) stages. Exogenous overexpression of miR-29b inhibited the proliferation but induced MM cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. FOXP1 was identified as a direct target gene for miR-29b, and restoration of FOXP1 weakened miR-29b-induced anti-proliferation and pro-apoptosis in MM cell lines. Finally, the inhibitory effects of miR-29b on the growth of MM tumors were validated in mice. CONCLUSIONS: miR-29b recedes the progression of MM via downregulating FOXP1, which may provide a potential biological target for MM treatment.

30080988|t|A triplex probe-based TaqMan qPCR assay for Calreticulin type I and II mutation detection.
30080988|a|BACKGROUND: Calreticulin (CALR) exon 9 frameshift mutations have recently been identified in 30-40% of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) without JAK2 or MPL mutations. We aimed to develop a qPCR assay to screen type I and II mutations of CALR. METHODS: Three different fluorescent-labeled hydrolysis probes and one pair of primers in a closed-tube system were developed to detect CALR type I and II mutations and distinguish them from wild-type. The sensitivity and specificity were validated using TA-cloning plasmids containing CALR wild-type and type I and II mutants, respectively. Fifty-nine ET and PMF specimens were screened by TaqMan qPCR and sequenced by Sanger sequencing. For intra-assay validation, 20 replicates of the assay were performed with each sample. For inter-assay validation, four replications of each sample were carried out and repeated continuously for 5 days. RESULTS: We found that triplex probe-based TaqMan qPCR was reliable in detecting CALR type I and II mutants within DNA that was diluted to 1% of total DNA with the wild-type DNA as background. In 59 patient specimens, six of the observed mutations of CALR were type I and five were type II. Genotyping results obtained from TaqMan qPCR were 100% concordant with Sanger sequencing. The intra- and inter-assay CVs of TaqMan qPCR were less than 3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Triplex probe-based TaqMan qPCR is an accurate and sensitive method for screening ET or PMF patients with type I and II mutations in CALR.

30121041|t|Dual carbon - chlorine isotope fractionation during dichloroelimination of 1,1,2-trichloroethane by an enrichment culture containing Dehalogenimonas sp.
30121041|a|Chlorinated ethanes are frequent groundwater contaminants but compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA) has been scarcely applied to investigate their degradation pathways. In this study, dual carbon and chlorine isotope fractionation was used to investigate for the first time the anoxic biodegradation of 1,1,2-trichloroethane (1,1,2-TCA) using a Dehalogenimonas-containing culture. The isotopic fractionation values obtained for the biodegradation of 1,1,2-TCA were eC = -6.9 +- 0.4% and eCl = -2.7 +- 0.3%. The detection of vinyl chloride (VC) as unique byproduct and a closed carbon isotopic mass balance corroborated that dichloroelimination was the degradation pathway used by this strain. Combining the values of delta13C and delta37Cl resulted in a dual element C-Cl isotope slope of Lambda = 2.5 +- 0.2%. Investigation of the apparent kinetic isotope effects (AKIEs) expected for cleavage of a CCl bond showed an important masking of the intrinsic isotope fractionation. Theoretical calculation of Lambda suggested that dichloroelimination of 1,1,2-TCA was taking place via simultaneous cleavage of two CCl bonds (concerted reaction mechanism). The isotope data obtained in this study can be useful to monitor natural attenuation of 1,1,2-TCA via dichloroelimination and provide insights into the source and fate of VC in contaminated groundwaters.

30124384|t|The clinical outcomes of chronic myeloid leukemia patients harboring alternatively spliced BCR-ABL variants.
30124384|a|Objectives and importance: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are indispensable for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, alternative splicing variants have been recently proposed as mechanisms of TKI resistance, although the clinical significance of these mutations remains controversial. We here present the long-term clinical courses of three CML patients harboring such unique mutations and try to assess their clinical significances. Moreover, the exon 6 frameshift presented here has been rarely reported, which may provide important information on this rare mutation. Clinical presentation: We report three cases of CML harboring an exon 7 deletion, insertion of 35 intronic nucleotides and an exon 6 frameshift, respectively. Remarkably, all patients obtained better than molecular response4.0 following administration of TKIs. Discussion and conclusion: Three CML cases highlighted an association between such splicing variants and clinical outcomes. The premature termination in the kinase domain due to these mutations likely causes conformational changes and inhibits TKI binding, but it also results in abrogating kinase activities of CML cells. Thus, the above-mentioned mutants might less affect outcomes of treatment. Noteworthy, clinically available International Scale RT-PCR system cannot distinguish kinase-active mutants from kinase-inactive mutants, which may possibly influence upon interpretation of the treatment efficacy. Clonal quantification on respective mutants could more precisely evaluate CML status in these patients. Therefore, one should realize these important splicing variants and accumulate further experiences.

30139310|t|Comparative study of bone marrow and blood plasma levels of IL-2 in aplastic anaemia and their relationship with disease severity.
30139310|a|OBJECTIVES: Interleukin-2 (alias: IL-2, TCGF, Lymphokine), a type of interleukin, is also a potent signalling molecule in the signalling cascade of the immune-mediated activation of T Lymphocytes leading to the destruction of haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) which is the basis of acquired aplastic anaemia (AAA). The objective was to study the association of IL-2 in the bone marrow plasma (BMP) and peripheral blood plasma (PBP) in AAA patients. METHODS: A total of 52 BMP and PBP-paired samples (both from the same patients) was collected from the confirmed AAA patients and 10 healthy individuals. The level of IL-2 was measured by the quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Significantly increased level of IL-2 was observed in the BMP than PBP of AAA patients. The level of IL-2 in PBP and BMP was found to be very low in the control cases. Considerably increased levels of IL-2 were found in the PBP and BMP of AAA patients as compared to controls (48.54 +- 21.89 vs. 1.99 +- 1.25 p-value &lt; 0.00001) and (75.33 +- 41.9 vs. 3.12 +- 1.82; p-value &lt; 0.00001) respectively. Among these patients, the IL-2 levels were higher in patients with Very Severe Aplastic Anaemia (VSAA) and Severe Aplastic Anaemia (SAA) than those with Non-severe Aplastic Anaemia (NSAA) in the PBP (65.6 +- 23.61 vs. 31.72 +- 7.64; p-value 0.00338) and (45.37 +- 16.25 vs. 31.72 +- 7.64; p-value 0.01468) respectively. Again the IL-2 levels were higher in patients with VSAA and SAA than those with NSAA in the BMP (115.01 +- 38.91 vs. 38.32 +- 19.49; p-value &lt; 0.00001) and (66.44 +- 23.34 vs. 38.32 +- 19.49; p-value 0.0006). The IL-2 level was higher in VSAA than SAA in PBP (65.6 +- 23.61vs. 45.37 +- 16.25; p-value 0.0114) and BMP (115.01 +- 38.91 vs. 66.44 +- 23.34; p-value 0.00044). CONCLUSION: This study emphasized on the bone marrow and blood plasma levels of IL-2 in aplastic anaemia and their relationship with disease severity. The results indicate towards the fact that IL-2 may have an important association with the marrow failure of AAA patients and thus can help in disease development. Further study is necessary for better understanding.

30235719|t|Hepatic toxicity following actinomycin D chemotherapy in treatment of familial gestational trophoblastic neoplasia: A case report.
30235719|a|RATIONALE: Familial hydatidiform mole is extremely rare while familial gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) has never been reported. Inspired by 2 biological sisters with postmolar GTN and liver toxicity, we reviewed susceptible maternal-effect genes and explored the role of possible drug transporter genes in the development of GTN. PATIENT CONCERNS: We reported one Chinese family where the two sisters developed postmolar GTN while experiencing fast remission and significant hepatic toxicity from actinomycin D chemotherapy. DIAGNOSES: The index pregnancy was diagnosed with curettage. The following GTN was confirmed when there was a rise in beta-hCG for three consecutive weekly measurements over at least a period of 2 weeks. Computed tomography was used to identify lung metastasis. The elder sister was diagnosed with gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (III: 2) while the younger sister was diagnosed as III: 3 according to WHO scoring system. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with actinomycin D of 10 mug/kg intravenously for 5 days every 2 weeks. When hepatic toxicity was indicated, polyene phosphatidyl choline and magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate were prescribed. OUTCOMES: Both patients responded extremely well to the 5-day actinomycin D regimen. Beta-hCG remained less than 2 mIU/ml after 5 cycles while computed tomography scan showed downsized pulmonary nodules. Both experienced significant rise in ALT and AST levels that could be ameliorated with corresponding medication. Monthly followed-up showed negative beta-hCG levels and normal liver enzyme levels. LESSONS: We speculated that the known or unknown NLRP7 and KHDC3L mutations might be correlated with drug disposition in liver while liver drug transporters such as P-glycoprotein family that are also expressed in trophoblasts might be correlated to GTN susceptibility. Future genomic profiles of large samples alike using next generation sequencing are needed to confirm our hypothesis and discover yet unknown genes.

30334700|t|Diagnostic utility of the lymphoid screening tube supplemented with CD34 for Ogata score calculation in patients with peripheral cytopenia.
30334700|a|OBJECTIVES: The diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is not always straightforward in the absence of objective markers such as ringed sideroblasts, an excess of blasts or clonal cytogenetic abnormalities. Moreover, the lack of specificity of morphological dysplasia makes the differentiation between MDS and other causes of peripheral cytopenia difficult. The WHO 2016 classification of MDS recognizes multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) as an adjuvant tool for MDS diagnosis. An easily applicable MFC protocol based on CD34 and CD45 is proposed by Ogata et al. Furthermore, in the diagnostic workup of patients with peripheral cytopenia, the integration of MFC by means of a Lymphoid Screening Tube (LST) is recommended by the EuroFlow  consortium. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the LST, supplemented with CD34, can be used to calculate the Ogata score, thereby obviating the need to run different flow cytometric tubes. METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 108 patients with peripheral cytopenia were analyzed (MDS n = 32; non-MDS n = 76). The LST used in the present study was based on the tube designed by the EuroFlow  consortium, but with addition of CD34 and without TCRgammadelta. RESULTS: Rather low sensitivities of 55% in low-grade MDS patients and 80% in high-grade MDS patients were observed. However, a high specificity of 92% was found in the non-MDS group. CONCLUSION: Besides screening for clonal lymphocytes, plasma cells and blasts, an LST supplemented with CD34 allows the calculation of the Ogata score as an adjuvant tool in the diagnostic workup of cytopenic patients suspected of MDS.

30382274|t|A 6-week supplementation with grape pomace to subjects at cardiometabolic risk ameliorates insulin sensitivity, without affecting other metabolic syndrome markers.
30382274|a|Grape polyphenols have shown a promising role in the modulation of metabolic syndrome (MetS), mostly in animal models. However, clinical studies are scarce and they usually only consider a fraction of polyphenols, ignoring the non-extractable polyphenols (high molecular weight compounds or associated with macromolecules such as dietary fibre). This study aimed at evaluating the effect of grape pomace, rich in both extractable and non-extractable polyphenols, on markers of MetS. Fifty subjects (22 women) aged 20-65 with at least two MetS factors were randomly assigned to the product (daily dose of 8 g of dried grape pomace) or to the control group in a 6 week crossover design with a 4 week wash-out. Samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of both periods; half of the participants were subjected to an oral glucose tolerance test at the beginning and the end of the supplementation period. Grape pomace supplementation significantly improved fasting insulinaemia (p &lt; 0.01), without affecting other cardiometabolic risk parameters. A tendency towards an improvement in postprandial insulinaemia was observed, particularly in those subjects with higher fasting insulin levels. Therefore, supplementation with grape pomace may be a strategy for improving insulin sensitivity in subjects at high cardiometabolic risk.

30412893|t|Dysregulation of let-7 by PEG modified graphene oxide in nematodes with deficit in epidermal barrier.
30412893|a|In nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, epidermal RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of bli-1 encoding a cuticular collagen caused the toxicity induction of GO-PEG (PEG surface modified graphene oxide). In this study, we further found that epidermal RNAi knockdown of bli-1 increased expression of a microRNA let-7, and let-7 mutation suppressed the susceptibility of bli-1(RNAi) nematodes to GO-PEG toxicity. let-7 regulated the toxicity induction of GO-PEG by suppressing expression and function of its direct targets (HBL-1 and LIN-41). Like the nematodes with epidermal RNAi knockdown of bli-1, epidermal RNAi knockdown of hbl-1 or lin-41 also induced functional abnormality in epidermal barrier. Therefore, a signaling cascade of BLI-1-let-7-HBL-1/LIN-41 was raised to be involved in GO-PEG toxicity induction. Our data imply the dysregulation of let-7-mediated molecular machinery for developmental timing control by GO-PEG in nematodes with deficit in epidermal barrier caused by bli-1(RNAi).

30415005|t|Inhibition of miR-423-5p suppressed prostate cancer through targeting GRIM-19.
30415005|a|OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of miR-423-5p on the progression of prostate cancer (PC). METHODS: miR-423-5p and GRIM-19 expressions were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. PC cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. PC cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Dual luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the interaction between miR-423-5p and GRIM-19. RESULTS: Compared with normal prostate tissues and prostate epithelial cell HPrEC, miR-423-5p was up-regulated in human PC tissues and PC3 cells, whereas GRIM-19 expression was decreased. Inhibition of miR-423-5p suppressed PC3 cell proliferation, promoted PC3 cell apoptosis, and decreased anti-apoptosis protein BCL-2 expression. GRIM-19 was a target of miR-423-5p, and GRIM-19 was negatively regulated by miR-423-5p in PC3 cells. In addition, miR-423-5p knockdown inhibited the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of PC3 cells through GRIM-19. In vivo experiments showed that miR-423-5p inhibitor administration reduced tumor volume, down-regulated miR-423-5p and GRIM-19 expressions in PC tissues of nude mice. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of miR-423-5p suppressed PC through targeting GRIM-19.

30453065|t|Independent association of whole blood miR-328 expression and polymorphism at 3'UTR of the PAX6 gene with myopia.
30453065|a|PURPOSE: This study aimed to find associations between miR-328 expression in whole blood, polymorphism at 3'UTR of the PAX6 gene (paired box homeotic gene 6) and myopia. METHODS: We evaluated 451 individuals (142 individuals with low, 49 with moderate and 13 with high-degree myopia, and 247 healthy individuals). DNA and RNA were extracted from peripheral blood samples. Expression of miR-328 was assessed and genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the PAX6 (rs662702) performed using the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction System. RESULTS: Moderate and high degree myopia showed significant differences between TT and CT genotypes of the PAX6 gene (p &lt; 0.001). In the myopia group, 71.4% of the subjects had the TT genotype and 28.6% had the CT genotype; meanwhile in the control group, 97.1% had the TT genotype and 2.9% had the CT genotype. The odds ratio of having moderate and/or high degree myopia for individuals with the CT genotype was 13.6 (2.865-64.55) 95% CI versus TT genotype (p = 0.001). MiR-328 results showed that  Ct values differed statistically significantly between the myopia and control groups. Patients with myopia in the peripheral blood cells had a higher expression of miR-328 than controls (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences were detected between the PAX6 gene (rs662702) TT and CT genotypes in moderate and high degree myopia; the risk C allele increased the risk for myopia. The expression level of miR-328 in peripheral blood cells was higher in patients with myopia than controls. We did not find the association between expression of mir-328 in the peripheral blood cells and PAX6 gene (rs662702) polymorphism comparing myopia and control groups.

30458286|t|LncRNAs expression in adriamycin-induced rats reveals the potential role of LncRNAs contributing to chronic glomerulonephritis pathogenesis.
30458286|a|BACKGROUND: Chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) is the most common form of primary glomerular disease with unclear molecular mechanisms. Currently, limited study on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in CGN is available. Our study aimed to identify potential lncRNAs and genes in the normal and adriamycin-induced CGN rats, which to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of CGN pathogenesis. METHODS: To identify LncRNAs specifically expressed in CGN, the expression of LncRNAs in glomerular tissues of rats from the adriamycin-induced group (n = 3) was compared with that in the control group (n = 3) using RNA-sequencing and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Identification of differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were performed between the 2 groups. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to analyze the biological functions and pathways for the differentially expressed mRNAs. LncRNA-mRNA co-expression network was constructed to analyses for the genes. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was visualized. RESULTS: A total of 114 significantly up-regulated and 86 down-regulated lncRNAs, 1038 up-regulated and 88 down-regulated mRNAs were identified. Additionally, Il6, with the highest connectivity degree in PPI network, was noteworthy enriched in various kinds pathways. Coding-non-coding gene co-expression networks (CNC network) were drawn based on the correlation analysis between the differentially expressed LncRNAs and mRNAs. Ten LncRNAs, NONRATT000964.2, NONRATT018086.2, NONRATT023684.2, NONRATT009530.2, NONRATT006315.2, NONRATT026805.2, MSTRG.9260.1, NONRATT009155.2, MSTRG.7681.1, NONRATT009275.2, were selected to analyze the relationship between LncRNAs and CGN via the CNC network and GO analysis. Real-time PCR result confirmed that the six LncRNAs were specifically expressed in the CGN rats. CONCLUSIONS: The ten LncRNAs were differentially expressed and might play important roles in the development of CGN. Key genes, such as Il6, Ptprc, TOP2a, Fos, Myc, etc., may be crucial biomarkers for CGN.

30458287|t|MiR-202-3p regulates interleukin-1beta-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 in human nucleus pulposus.
30458287|a|MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNA molecules, have emerged as important factors during intervertebral disc degeneration. This study was to determine whether miR-202-3p regulates interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) in human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. Human NP cells were stimulated with IL-1beta in vitro. MicroRNA arrays were used to determine the expression profile of 1971 human miRNAs and the miRNAs targets were identified using bioinformatics. In IL-1beta-stimulated NP cells, 10 microRNAs were down-regulated, 2 microRNAs were up-regulated. There was a significant reduction in hsa-miR-202-3p (miR-202-3p) expression in the severe degenerative disc compared with mild degenerative disc. Down-regulation of miR-202-3p expression by IL-1beta was correlated with up-regulation of MMP-1 expression in human NP cells. IL-1beta-induced activation of MAP kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) decreased miR-202-3p expression and induced MMP-1 expression. MiR-202-3p suppressed IL-1beta-induced MMP-1 production. Conversely, treatment with anti-miR-202-3p remarkably increased MMP-1 production. In addition, mutation of the miR-202-3p binding site in the 3'-UTR of MMP-1 mRNA abolished miR-202-3p-mediated repression of reporter activity. Functional analysis showed that miR-202-3p could decrease type II collagen degradation, whereas overexpression of MMP-1 by Lentiviral-shMMP-1 abolished the effect of miR-202-3p on type II collagen degradation. These results suggest that miR-202-3p is an important regulator of MMP-1 in human nucleus pulposus and may contribute to the development of intervertebral disc degeneration.

30468908|t|Evaluation of miRNA-9 and miRNA-34a as potential biomarkers for diagnosis of breast cancer in Iranian women.
30468908|a|PURPOSE: MicroRNAs are involved in diverse biological processes and their dysregulation is a common event in various diseases including breast cancer. Breast cancer is a major threat to women's health. This study was designed to examine the expression levels of miR-9 and miR-34a in breast tumor tissue samples and plasma of breast cancer patients, compare their expression pattern between tissue samples and plasma samples of patients and analyze their relationship with tumor clinical features. Also, the potential of these miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for breast cancer was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression levels of miR-9, miR-34a and CDH1 were measured by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and DeltaDeltact method. Data were analyzed using t-test and one-way ANOVA. The sensitivity and specificity of miRNAs were determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The expression levels of miR-9 and miR-34a were significantly down-regulated in tumor tissues compared to healthy tissues (fold change = 0.26, p = 0.0051 for miR-9 and fold change = 0.55, p = 0.021 for miR-34a). While no significant difference was observed in the expression levels of miR-9 (p = 0.205) and miR-34a (p = 0.132) in plasma samples of patients compared to normal plasma. CDH1 expression in tumor tissue was not significantly different from normal tissue (p = 0.33). We found that expression level of miR-9 in patients with tumor size larger than 5 cm (p = 0.026) and expression level of miR-34a in patients with higher stage (lll &amp; lV, p = 0.03) were significantly down-regulated. Also miR-34a expression level was positively correlated with patient's age (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: According to the ROC curves, the area under the curve (AUC) of miR-9 in tissue was 0.71 (p = 0.009) with sensitivity 83.33% and specificity 70.37%. The AUC for miR-34a in tissue was 0.72 (p = 0.007) with sensitivity 72% and specificity 76%. Thus miR-9 and miR-34a have the capability for distinguishing tumor tissues from healthy tissues and the study of their expression levels in tissue may be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis of breast cancer patients from healthy women.

30471602|t|Distribution of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes in Lake Tai, China.
30471602|a|Lake Tai is China's third largest freshwater lake and an important water resource for agriculture, industrial sectors, and as drinking water for several large cities. In this study, the occurrence of five antibiotic resistance genes (sul1, blaTEM, blaNDM-1, blaCTX-M-32, mcr-1) was investigated in water and sediment samples collected from Lake Tai. Antibiotic resistances are currently increasing, posing a significant threat to public health. The sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 was highly abundant in all analyzed water and sediment samples. In addition, the two beta-lactamase genes blaTEMand blaNDM-1 - encoding clinically relevant antibiotic resistances - were detected in 67.1 and 7.3% of the water samples and in 70.7 and 15.4% of the sediment samples. The third beta-lactamase gene, blaCTX-M-32, was only detected in water samples (13.4%), while the colistin resistance gene mcr-1 was not detected in any of the samples. No significant variations between different sampling sites or time points could be observed. The investigation of drinking water treatment at Lake Tai, using lake water as influent, showed a significant reduction of the antibiotic resistance genes through the treatment process. Microbial source tracking showed only low fecal contamination by humans, ruminants, and pigs, indicating the relevance of other sources such as fish farms. Overall, our results provide important insights into the occurrence and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in the Lake Tai water system and their elimination via drinking water treatment.

30503393|t|Expression pattern of nanos, piwil, dnd, vasa and pum genes during ontogenic development in Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus.
30503393|a|Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are specified by maternally provided determinants in fish. PGCs migrate then into prospective gonadal sites during early development and give rise to germ cell lineage. PGC disrupted animals do not sexually mature which has a range of commercial as well as environmental benefits. To find potential target genes for sterilisation of Nile tilapia, relative mRNA abundance patterns and tissue distribution of four nanos, two piwil, dnd1, vasa and three pum genes were investigated during ontogenic development from unfertilised eggs to newly hatched larvae and in adult tissues, respectively. The ontogenic pattern of RNA abundance revealed that all the investigated gene transcripts are maternally deposited to varying degrees, except for nanos2 which is not expressed in eggs. The ontogenic patterns of relative RNA abundance could be grouped into three categories. The first one, including nanos3, piwil1, piwil2, dnd1 and vasa, showed abundant transcript levels during early developmental stages which are then degraded during the period of maternal to zygotic transition between blastula and gastrula stages with a reduction in expression of four to five orders of magnitude by hatching stage. Another, including pum2 and pum3, showed similar patterns to the first group, but the transcript levels are reduced by only two orders of magnitude. The third group, including nanos1a, nanos1b and pum1, was characterised by a zygotic increase. nanos2 had no detectable transcripts until hatching stage. The tissue screening of nanos1a, nanos1b, pum1, pum2 and pum3 showed that they are expressed in various tissues, implying their potential pleiotropic effects in these tissues apart from gonads. In contrast, nanos3, piwil1, piwil2, dnd1 and vasa appeared to be exclusively expressed in gonads (both ovary and testis), and nanos2 showed testis-specific expression. Based on these results nanos3, piwil1, piwil2, dnd1 and vasa were prioritised among the 11 selected genes as potential target genes for sterilisation in Nile tilapia as they have no significant zygotic expression during embryogenesis, they are expressed exclusively in gonads and maternally deposited. These features suggest a potential role of these genes in the specification and maintenance of PGCs during the ontogenic development of Nile tilapia.

30503395|t|Zinc finger antisense 1: A long noncoding RNA with complex roles in human cancers.
30503395|a|Zinc finger antisense 1 (ZFAS1), a newly identified long non-coding RNA, is a transcript antisense to the 5' end of the protein-coding gene zinc finger NFX1-type containing 1 which hosts three C/D-box small nucleolar RNAs (SNORDs) within sequential introns: Snord12, Snord12b, and Snord12c. ZFAS1 is dysregulated and acts as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor in different human malignancies. ZFAS1 has been implicated in many aspects of carcinogenesis, including proliferation, invasion, metastasis, apoptosis, cell cycle, and drug resistance. The mechanisms underlying the effects of ZFAS1 are complex and involve multiple signaling pathways. In this review, the multiple pathological functions of ZFAS1 in diverse malignancies are systematically reviewed to elucidate the molecular basis of its biological roles and to provide new directions for future research.

30521888|t|Identification and molecular analysis of a lncRNA-HOTAIR transcript from secondary hair follicle of cashmere goat reveal integrated regulatory network with the expression regulated potentially by its promoter methylation.
30521888|a|The HOTAIR transcript is transcribed from the antisense strand within the HOXC gene cluster, and it is thought to play a role in regulating the inductive capacity of dermal papilla cells during the reconstruction of hair-follicle. In the current investigation, we firstly isolated and characterized a lncRNA-HOTAIR transcript from the secondary hair follicle of cashmere goat. Also, we analyzed its transcriptional pattern and methylation level of HOTAIR gene promoter in secondary hair follicle of cashmere goat during anagen and telogen stages. Nucleotide composition analysis indicated that the contents of Adenine (A) and Thymine (T) are higher than that of Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) in lncRNA-HOTAIR transcript of cashmere goat with the highest frequency distribution of AG nucleotide pair (8.06%). The regulatory network analysis showed a directly or indirectly complex regulatory relationships between lncRNA-HOTAIR of cashmere goat and its potential target molecules: miRNAs, mRNAs and proteins. Also, we showed that lncRNA-HOTAIR was properly transcribed at both anagen and telogen stages of secondary hair follicle of cashmere goat with the anagen being significantly higher than telogen in its expression, which suggest that lncRNA-HOTAIR transcript might be involved in the reconstruction of secondary hair follicle with the formation and growth of cashmere fiber. Taken together with methylation analysis of HOTAIR gene promoter, our data suggest that the promoter methylation of HOTAIR gene most likely is involved in its transcriptional suppression in secondary hair follicle of cashmere goat.

30528268|t|Analysis of differential gene expression by RNA-seq data in ABCG1 knockout mice.
30528268|a|AIMS: The previous studies on ABCG1 using genetically modified mice showed inconsistent results on atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether accurate target knockout of ABCG1 would result in transcriptional changes of other atherosclerosis-related genes. METHODS: ABCG1 knockout mouse model was obtained by precise gene targeting without affecting non-target DNA sequences in C57BL/6 background. The wildtype C57BL/6 mice were regarded as control group. 12-week-old male mice were used in current study. We performed whole transcriptome analysis on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from ABCG1 knockout mice (n = 3) and their wildtype controls (n = 3) by RNA-seq. RESULTS: Compared with wildtype group, 605 genes were modified at the time of ABCG1 knockout and expressed differentially in knockout group, including 306 up-regulated genes and 299 down-regulated genes. 54 genes were associated with metabolism regulation, of which 13 were related to lipid metabolism. We also found some other modified genes in knockout mice involved in cell adhesion, leukocyte transendothelial migration and apoptosis, which might also play roles in the process of atherosclerosis. 7 significantly enriched GO terms and 19 significantly enriched KEGG pathways were identified, involving fatty acid biosynthesis, immune response and intracellular signal transduction. CONCLUSIONS: ABCG1 knockout mice exhibited an altered expression of multiple genes related to many aspects of atherosclerosis, which might affect the further studies to insight into the effect of ABCG1 on atherosclerosis with this animal model.

30529248|t|Toxic function of CD28 involving in the TLR/MyD88 signal pathway in the river pufferfish (Takifugu obscurus) after exposed to tributyltin chloride (TBT-Cl).
30529248|a|Cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28) is a co-stimulatory receptor found on the surface of T cells. Takifugu obscurus is a kind of anadromous fish species. In this study, the full-length sequence of To-CD28 was obtained, including a 672-bp open reading frame that encodes a peptide chain of 223 amino acids. The phylogenetic analysis showed that To-CD28 is similar to the CD28 protein in Takifugu rubripes. The total hematocyte count distinctly decreased after TBT-Cl exposure, showing the adverse effects of TBT-Cl invasion and self-adjusting ability upon To-CD28 accumulation. The production of reactive oxygen species increased, demonstrating the oxidation resistance of T. obscurus when exposed to TBT-Cl. The tissue expression patterns indicated To-CD28 is a widely distributed receptor in T. obscurus. Its high expression in the liver and gill suggests that To-CD28 could be potentially functioned in TBT-Cl toxic process. The mRNA levels of To-CD28 and relative genes in the TLR-MyD88 signal pathway were significantly up-regulated under TBT-Cl exposure. The immunohistochemistry also showed that the To-CD28 protein signal was enhanced under TBT-Cl exposure, which proved that the positive protection of To-CD28 for maintaining homeostasis. Our study indicated that To-CD28 might participate in the toxicity mechanism upon TBT-Cl exposure and regulate homeostasis stability of T. obscurus.

30536466|t|Understanding the importance of low-molecular weight (ethylene oxide- and propylene oxide-induced) DNA adducts and mutations in risk assessment: Insights from 15 years of research and collaborative discussions.
30536466|a|The interpretation and significance of DNA adduct data, their causal relationship to mutations, and their role in risk assessment have been debated for many years. An extended effort to identify key questions and collect relevant data to address them was focused on the ubiquitous low MW N7-alkyl/hydroxyalkylguanine adducts. Several academic, governmental, and industrial laboratories collaborated to gather new data aimed at better understanding the role and potential impact of these adducts in quantifiable genotoxic events (gene mutations/micronucleus). This review summarizes and evaluates the status of dose-response data for DNA adducts and mutations from recent experimental work with standard mutagenic agents and ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, and the importance for risk assessment. This body of evidence demonstrates that small N7-alkyl/hydroxyalkylguanine adducts are not pro-mutagenic and, therefore, adduct formation alone is not adequate evidence to support a mutagenic mode of action. Quantitative methods for dose-response analysis and derivation of thresholds, benchmark dose (BMD), or other points-of-departure (POD) for genotoxic events are now available. Integration of such analyses of genetox data is necessary to properly assess any role for DNA adducts in risk assessment. Regulatory acceptance and application of these insights remain key challenges that only the regulatory community can address by applying the many learnings from recent research. The necessary tools, such as BMDs and PODs, and the example datasets, are now available and sufficiently mature for use by the regulatory community. Environ. Mol.

30543962|t|Synergistic effects of sulfur dioxide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on pulmonary pro-fibrosis via mir-30c-1-3p/ transforming growth factor beta type II receptor axis.
30543962|a|SO2 and PAHs are well-known pollutants of coal burning and significant contributors to haze episodes. The purpose of the study is to determine whether the combined effects of SO2 and BaP are synergetic and to investigate the pro-fibrotic influences and possible mechanism from the aspect of microRNAs. In the present study cellular metabolic activity of BEAS-2B was assessed using MTT probe. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to BaP (40 mg/kg b.w.) for 5 days or SO2 (7 mg/m3) inhalation for 4 weeks alone or together. Lung tissues were processed for histology to assess pulmonary fibrosis. The protein level of pulmonary pro-fibrotic genes (Col1a1, Col3a1, alpha-SMA, fibronectin) and TGFbetaR2 were analyzed by Western blot and immunofluorescence in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we clarified that the microRNA expression of mir-30c-1-3p by real-time RT-PCR. The luciferase reporter assay was used to determine the binding sites of mir-30c-1-3p in the 3'-UTR of TGFbetaR2. It was confirmed that SO2 and BaP acted together to produce synergistic effects in cellular metabolic activity. Coexisting of SO2 and BaP increased the protein expression of pro-fibrotic genes and TGFbetaR2 and decreased mir-30c-1-3p in vivo and in vitro. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assays showed that TGFbetaR2 was a validated target of mir-30c-1-3p. All above results demonstrated that mir-30c-1-3p was involved in the synergistic pro-fibrotic effects of SO2 and BaP in lung via targeting TGFbetaR2. This work implies the potential risk of pulmonary fibrosis from the co-existence of SO2 and PAHs and provides new insights into the molecular markers for relevant diseases.

30552979|t|Integrational analysis of miRNAs data sets as a plausible missing linker between Epstein-Barr virus and vitamin D in relapsing remitting MS patients.
30552979|a|Given the multifactorial state of autoimmune complex diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), it is not clear if different risk factors act jointly or independently. Despite intensive studies investigating multi aspects of MS risk factors, findings with regards to potential biomarkers that may link these risk factors remained largely inconclusive. System biology or data integration utilizes different validated datasets to extract meaningful information and map the plausible biological pathways and networks. As such, we integrated eight transcriptome datasets to find the differentially expressed miRNAs in peripheral blood (PB) between relapsing remitting MS patients (RRMS) and normal group. After identification the targeted genes of miRNAs, the hub genes were used to construct the underlying protein-protein interaction network and signaling pathways. As results, 9 miRNAs were best exemplified by significant dysregulation including hsa-mir-15a, hsa-mir-484, hsa-mir-30d, hsa-mir-145, hsa-mir-363, has-let-7e, hsa-mir-30a, hsa-let-7b, and hsa-mir-146a. System biology analysis of miRNAs in PB of RRMS patients clearly indicates the involvement of miRNAs in many vital pathways and highlighted the possibility of an association between miRNAs with EBV and vitamin D in MS pathogenesis. Described novel pathways and genes related to miRNAs such as Transient receptor potential channels and Acid sphingomyelinase may provide a potential target for therapeutic approaches although further functional studies are warranted to test these candidates.

30562548|t|Parathyroid hormone-stimulation of Runx2 during osteoblast differentiation via the regulation of lnc-SUPT3H-1:16 (RUNX2-AS1:32) and miR-6797-5p.
30562548|a|Parathyroid hormone (PTH) acts as a regulator of calcium homeostasis and bone remodeling. Runx2, an essential transcription factor in bone, is required for osteoblast differentiation. Noncoding RNAs such as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in regulating gene expression in osteoblasts. In this study, we investigated the effects of PTH on osteoblast differentiation via Runx2, lncRNA, and miRNA expression in human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) and human osteoblastic cells (MG63). PTH-treatment of hBMSCs for 24 h, 7 days, and 14 days stimulated Runx2 mRNA expression. Using bioinformatics tools, we identified 17 lncRNAs originating from human Runx2 gene. Among these, lnc-SUPT3H-1:16 (RUNX2-AS1:32) expression was highly up-regulated by the 7 d PTH-treatment in hBMSCs. We also identified miR-6797-5p as the putative target of lnc-SUPT3H-1:16 and Runx2 using bioinformatics tools. PTH-treatment increased the expression of miR-6797-5p in hBMSCs, and overexpression of miR-6797-5p decreased osteoblast differentiation in MG63 cells, suggesting a role for lnc-SUPT3H-1:16 as sponge molecule. A luciferase gene reporter assay identified direct targeting of miR-6797-5p with lnc-SUPT3H-1:16 and 3'UTR Runx2 in MG63 cells. Thus, PTH stimulated the expression of lnc-SUPT3H-1:16, miR-6797-5p and Runx2, and due to the sponging mechanism of lnc- SUPT3H-1:16 towards miR-6797-5p, Runx2 was protected, resulting in the promotion of osteoblast differentiation.

30572096|t|Mitochondrial genetic markers for authentication of major Red Sea grouper species (Perciformes: Serranidae) in Egypt: A tool for enhancing fisheries management and species conservation.
30572096|a|Groupers are coral fish species of prime ecological and economic significance. The interactions among them and other coral reefs organisms aid the healthiness and species balance in this fundamental marine niches. Also, groupers are among the top priced fisheries species. The Egyptian habitats of the Red Sea are lacking genetic studies that assess species diversity for the final goal of conservation and fisheries management. Moreover, morphological similarities among these organisms sometimes hinder a proper species identification. Hence, more accurate groupers authentication methods are crucially required. Sixteen grouper species belonging to the genera Epinephelus, Anyperodon, Cephaolopholes, Aethaloperca, Variola, and Plectropomus, present in the Red Sea in Egypt, were investigated for species authentication through mitochondrial DNA variations, applying cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and 12srRNA genes sequencing. GenBank comparisons, phylogenetic analyses and comparisons of pairwise distances were carried out. All these analyses aimed to species authentication and identifying their relations at the international scale.

30576808|t|Circular RNA HIPK3 promotes glioma progression by binding to miR-124-3p.
30576808|a|This study aims to investigate whether circ-HIPK3 could promote the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells by upregulating STAT3 after binding to miR-124-3p, thus participating in the development of glioma. Expression levels of circ-HIPK3, miR-124-3p and STAT3 in glioma cell lines were determined using qRT-PCR. The regulatory effects of circ-HIPK3, miR-124-3p and STAT3 on proliferative and invasive capacities of glioma cells were accessed using EdU assay, CCK-8 assay and invasion assay, respectively. Cell cycle assay and cell apoptosis assay were performed by flow cytometry. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted to determine the binding condition among circ-HIPK3, miR-124-3p and STAT3. Rescue experiments were performed in co-transfected glioma cells. QRT-PCR data showed that circ-HIPK3 and STAT3 are highly expressed, whereas miR-124-3p is lowly expressed in glioma cells than those of negative control cell. Knockdown of circ-HIPK3 in U87 and U251 cells inhibited their proliferative and invasive capacities. On the contrary, miR-124-3p knockdown improved proliferative and migratory capacities. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay exerted that circ-HIPK3 could bind to miR-124-3p and STAT3 is the target gene of miR-124-3p. Western blot results elucidated that circ-HIPK3 stabilizes STAT3 expression, whereas miR-124-3p degrades STAT3 expression. Rescue experiments demonstrated that overexpression of circ-HIPK3 could partially reverse the inhibited proliferative and migratory capacities induced by miR-124-3p in U87 and U251 cells. In summary, we found that overexpression of circ-HIPK3 promotes proliferative and invasive capacities of glioma cells by sponging miR-124-3p to upregulate STAT3 expression.

30580162|t|Tissue-specific transcriptional regulation of seven heavy metal stress-responsive miRNAs and their putative targets in nickel indicator castor bean (R. communis L.) plants.
30580162|a|R.communis L. has high capability to accumulate nickel which is a trace nutrient for higher plants and also an environmental contaminant causes toxicity related symptoms at higher concentrations. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to be important modulators of responses against heavy metal stress for detoxification of the metal. In this study, we experimentally measured and validated the transcript levels of the seven heavy metal stress response-related miRNAs and the expression levels of target genes in both leaf and root tissues of R. communis L. subjected to three different concentrations of nickel stress via qRT-PCR quantification. The results demonstrated differential regulations of heavy metal stress-responsive miRNAs and their putative targets in both tissues in same stress treatments. This dynamic regulation suggest that regulatory processes differ between the tissues under nickel stress. Our data suggest that, miR838 was the most responsive to the Ni2+ stress. miR398 target gene Cu-Zn/SOD was found to be up-regulated in both root and leaf tissues. The relations between TCP and expression levels of miR159 and miR319 were also found statistically significant exclusive to leaf tissues. In leaf tissue, changes in miR395 level and its putative target genes, sulphate transporter and sulphate adenyltransferase gene were found in relation whereas, only expression level of sulphate transporter represented a statistically significant relation in root tissue. The sharp decrease in transcript levels of 2r3 myb gene at lower nickel dose suggest to investigate the role of r2r3 myb and the all MYB family members in primary and secondary metabolisms against nickel stress.

30583411|t|The effect of cooking on umami compounds in wild and cultivated mushrooms.
30583411|a|The effect of cooking on the taste compounds of five mushroom species Agaricus bisporus, Lactarius trivialis, Cantharellus cibarius, Cantharellus tubaeformis and Suillus variegatus were assessed with a special focus on the compounds responsible for the umami taste. Liquid chromatography was used to analyse free amino acids (FAAs) and 5'-nucleotides from fresh and sous vide (SV) cooked mushroom samples and cooking juice. The SV technique enabled analysis of entire mushrooms, including the liquid released during cooking. FAA content decreased when cooking temperature increased, indicating their further chemical reactions. S. variegatus contained highest concentrations of FAAs in analysed wild mushrooms. The umami-enhancing nucleotide 5'-GMP was detected only in cooked samples, concentration being likely dependent on enzymatic activity. The highest concentration of 5'-GMP was detected in cooked L. trivialis samples (17 mg/100 g fw). To our knowledge, the analysed taste compounds of L. trivialis and S. variegatus are documented for the first time.

30583435|t|Development and validation of an HPLC-DAD-MS method for determination of four nucleoside compounds in the New Zealand native mushroom Hericium sp.
30583435|a|To identify and quantify the content of nucleoside compounds in the New Zealand native edible mushroom Hericium sp., a high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a triple quadrupole detector mass method was developed and validated. Four nucleoside substitutes, namely cytidine, uridine, adenosine, and guanosine, were identified. Optimization was conducted to study the effect of extraction method type, solvent pH, and extraction time. The optimal conditions were obtained using ultrasonic treatment in water at pH 3.8 for 30 min. For chromatographic separation, a C18 column was applied using 0.1% formic acid (pH 3.4) as the mobile phase with detection at 260 nm. The total concentration of the four nucleoside compounds was high, at 10.7 mg/g dry weight, indicating a potential benefit for human health. The excellent validation results based on selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy and robustness revealed the reliability of the newly developed analytical method, which could be applied routinely in research laboratories.

30591638|t|Comparative Study of Chemical, Biochemical Characteristic and ATR-FTIR Analysis of Seeds, Oil and Flour of the Edible Fedora Cultivar Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.).
30591638|a|A series of chemical and biochemical parameters of edible hemp resources (seeds, oil, and flour) from the monoecious EU registered hemp genotype Fedora, was determined, including fatty acid profile, phytosterol composition, total phenolics, antioxidant activity, macro- and micro-elements. The fatty acid omega-3/omega-6 approached the nutritionally optimal 3/1 ratio. beta-sitosterol and other phytosterols sterols dominated the unsaponifiable fraction. Hemp seeds, flour, and oil contained 767 +- 41, 744 +- 29, and 21 +- 5 mg GAE kg-1 total polyphenols, respectively. The antioxidant potential of Fedora flour and seeds, evaluated through the DPPH (2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assay, was higher than that of oil. K and Mg were the most abundant macro-elements, particularly in flour, while the concentration of trace elements was Fe &gt; Cu &gt; Ni &gt; Mn. The presence of an array of bioactive compound candidate Fedora products as health-promoting food matrices. The ATR-FTIR spectra of hemp-derived products indicated the proximate composition of macro-nutrients.

30593917|t|Bmo-miR-79 downregulates the expression of BmEm4 in the silkworm, Bombyx mori.
30593917|a|MicroRNA is an important regulation factor in insect development and metamorphosis. It has been reported that E(spl)m4 is a miRNA-targeted gene, as well as the target of the Notch signaling pathway in Drosophila. The expression of E(spl)m4 can be regulated by microRNA and further affect the neural development of Drosophila. Here, we found that BmEm4, an ortholog of E(spl)m4 from Bombyx mori, was the target gene of bmo-miR-79, with target sites containing the Brd and K boxes of the BmEm4_3'UTR, which was validated by the dual luciferase reporter (DLR) assay. Furthermore, bmo-miR-79 mimics can inhibit the expression of BmEm4 in BmN cells after transfection, and bmo-miR-79 can also inhibit the expression of BmEm4 in different developmental stages of Bombyx mori at a posttranscriptional level, to different degrees. The EMSA test further showed that bmo-miR-79 could bind to BmAGO2, which is the Bombyx mori argonaute2 protein, suggesting that bmo-miR-79 might regulate the expression of BmEm4 by forming miRISC complexes with BmAGO2. Taken together, bmo-miR-79 could regulate the expression of BmEm4 mediated by BmAGO2 and further affect its function in the silkworm Bombyx mori.

30594026|t|Polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinol and phenolic metabolites from the aerial parts of Hypericum elatoides and their neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory activities.
30594026|a|A phytochemical study on the aerial parts of Hypericum elatoides led to the isolation of a previously undescribed polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinol derivative, hyperelatone A, seven previously undescribed phenolic metabolites, hyperelatones B-H, along with ten known analogues. The structures of hyperelatones A-H were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, HRESIMS experiment, single-crystal X-ray diffraction and comparison of experimental and calculated ECD spectra, as well as chemical derivatization. All compounds were evaluated for their neuroprotective activity against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cell injury in rat pheochromocytoma PC-12 cells and inhibitory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in BV-2 microglial cells. Hyperelatones B-D and H, cinchonain Ib, and tenuiside A showed noticeable neuroprotection at concentrations of 1.0-100.0 muM. Hyperelatones D, G, and H, (-)-epicatechin, tenuiside A, and (Z)-3-hexenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside exhibited significant anti-neuroinflammatory activity with IC50 values ranging from 0.75 +- 0.02 to 5.83 +- 0.23 muM.

30594254|t|Anti-ICAM-1 antibody-modified nanostructured lipid carriers: a pulmonary vascular endothelium-targeted device for acute lung injury therapy.
30594254|a|BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome without effective treatment. Targeting delivery of glucocorticoid to lung shows potential efficacy for ALI based on their anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties, breaking through their clinical application limitation due to systemic side effects. This work was aimed to establish lung-targeted dexamethasone (DEX) loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) with opposite surface charge and investigate their therapeutic effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mice. RESULTS: The diameter of anionic anti-intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (anti-ICAM-1) antibody-conjugated DEX-loaded NLCs (ICAM/DEX/NLCs) and the cationic ones with octadecylamine (ODA) modification (ICAM/DEX/ODA-NLCs) was about 249.9 and 235.9 nm. The zeta potential of ICAM/DEX/NLCs and ICAM/DEX/ODA-NLCs was about - 30.3 and 37.4 mV, respectively. Relative to the non-targeted control and ICAM/DEX/ODA-NLCs, ICAM/DEX/NLCs exhibited higher in vitro cellular uptake in LPS-activated human vascular endothelial cell line EAhy926 after CAM-mediated endocytosis, and stronger in vivo pulmonary distribution in the ALI model mice. In vivo i.v. administration of ICAM/DEX/NLCs significantly attenuated pulmonary inflammatory cells infiltration, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and IL-6 in ALI mice. H&amp;E stain also revealed positive histological improvements by ICAM/DEX/NLCs.

30597233|t|Identification and expression profiles of putative leaf growth related microRNAs in maize (Zea mays L.) hybrid ADA313.
30597233|a|Throughout the plant life cycle, growth of new leaves is governed by cell division and cell expansion. During steady-state growth of the maize leaf, these processes are spatially separated between the meristem zone, consisting of dividing cells at the leaf base, the elongation zone, consisting of expanding cells moving upwards from the meristem, and the mature zone containing differentiated mature cells. Increased leaf size can be achieved through increasing cell number or cell size, for example by manipulating the genes controlling the transition between those zones. In this study, microRNA (miRNA) genes, which are a class of endogenous small, non-coding gene regulatory RNAs, were investigated in the growth zones, to gain insight into their role in the transition between cell division and cell expansion. A genome-wide survey was conducted using a miRNA-microarray and 59 miRNA genes were detected to be differentially expressed between the growth zones. miR160, miR166, miR168, miR172, miR319 and miR390 families were significantly up-regulated in the meristem relative to the elongation and mature zones. In contrast, expression of the miR167 and miR396 families was lower in the meristem and higher in the mature zone. Therefore, these were considered to be candidate growth-regulated miRNAs that control cell division processes indirectly by repressing target genes. The miR156, miR166, miR167, miR399, miR408 and miR2275 families were expressed most highly in the elongation zone, and so were classified as elongation-specific, with possible roles in switching from cell division to cell elongation during leaf differentiation. In silico target prediction analysis showed that these miRNAs target several transcription factors and metabolic genes, and a reciprocal relationship between the expression levels of miR319 and miR396 and their targets was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, 12 candidate novel miRNAs were identified from the microarray data and computationally verified. Three out of twelve were also validated by qRT-PCR. These findings provide important information regarding the regulatory functions of miRNAs in controlling progression of growth mechanisms.

30597234|t|Exosomes derived miR-126 attenuates oxidative stress and apoptosis from ischemia and reperfusion injury by targeting ERRFI1.
30597234|a|AIMS: Acute myocardial infarction is one of the most threaten disease in the world. In previous studies, exosome derived miR-126 has been verified that exert an pro-angiogenic function through exosomal transfer. However, the function of miR-126 in ischemic reperfusion injury remains unknown. The aim of the study was to investigate the function and mechanism of miR-126 in ischemic reperfusion injury. METHODS: H2O2 and CoCl2-treated neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to analyze the function of miR-126 in vitro. Tunel, JC-1, ROS, LDH and cell survival rates were detected to evaluate the function of miR-126. Rat acute myocardial infarction was performed to elucidate the function of miR-126 in vivo. RESULTS: We found that miR-126 could reduce the apoptosis and improved cell survival of H2O2-treated and CoCl2-treated neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. MiR-126 also attenuates the ROS elevation and mitochondrial membrane potential through JC-1 detection. miR-126 also improved the cardiac function in vivo. Luciferase activity revealed that miR-126 could bind to ERRFI1, suggesting miR-126 functioned through regulating ERRFI1. CONCLUSION: We verified the function and mechanism of miR-126 and provide evidence that miR-126 may play important role in ischemic reperfusion injury, and understanding the precise role of miR-126 will undoubtedly shed new light on the clinical treatment.

30599235|t|Long non-coding RNA SAP30L-AS1 promotes prostate cancer growth through repressing SAP30L.
30599235|a|Accumulating evidences have demonstrated the importance of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in initiation and progression of various cancers, including prostate cancer. LncRNA SAP30L-AS1 is previously identified in the plasma of prostate cancer patients. In this study, we further investigated the expression of SAP30L-AS1 in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Moreover, we explored the biological roles and mechanisms of action of SAP30L-AS1 in prostate cancer. The expression of SAP30L-AS1 is found to be increased in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues and normal prostate epithelial cell line, respectively. Increased expression of SAP30L-AS1 is associated with greater Gleason score, advanced pathological T stage, and poor over survival of prostate cancer patients. Functional assays demonstrated that ectopic expression of SAP30L-AS1 promotes prostate cancer proliferation and inhibits prostate cancer apoptosis. SAP30L-AS1 knockdown represses prostate cancer proliferation and induces prostate cancer apoptosis. Furthermore, SAP30L-AS1 knockdown represses prostate cancer xenograft growth in vivo. Mechanistic investigation revealed that SAP30L-AS1 physically binds to the promoter of SAP30L and represses SAP30L expression. The expression of SAP30L is negatively associated with that of SAP30L-AS1 in prostate cancer tissues. Rescue assays demonstrated that overexpression of SAP30L attenuated the roles of SAP30L-AS1 in promoting prostate cancer proliferation and inhibiting prostate cancer apoptosis. In conclusion, SAP30L-AS1 is upregulated and has oncogenic roles in prostate cancer via repressing SAP30L. Our data suggest that SAP30L-AS1 may be a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for prostate cancer.

30611468|t|Identification of hydroxytyrosyl oleate, a derivative of hydroxytyrosol with anti-inflammatory properties, in olive oil by-products.
30611468|a|Hydroxytyrosyl esters with short, medium and long acyl chains were evaluated for their ability to reduce nitric oxide (NO) production by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Among the compounds tested, C18 esters, namely hydroxytyrosyl stearate (HtySte) and hydroxytyrosyl oleate (HtyOle), were found to decrease NO production in a concentration-dependent manner, while the other compounds, including the parent hydroxytyrosol, were ineffective in the tested concentration range (0.5-5 muM). Further study of the potential immune-modulating properties of HtyOle revealed a significant and concentration-dependent suppression of prostaglandin E2 production. At a transcriptional level, HtyOle inhibited the expression of inducible NO synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and interleukin-1beta. Moreover, HtyOle was identified for the first time in olive oil by-products by means of high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. By contrast, HtyOle was not found in intact olives. Our results suggest that HtyOle is formed during oil processing and represents a significant form in which hydroxytyrosol occurs.

30611507|t|Synthesis of lactose lauryl ester in organic solvents using aluminosilicate zeolite as a catalyst.
30611507|a|Sugar-based biosurfactants are safer and healthier alternatives to synthetic surfactants especially for use in the food industry. In this work, biosurfactants were synthesized via the esterification of lactose with lauric acid in different organic solvents without using lipase or other enzymes. Commercial aluminosilicate zeolite was used as a catalyst. Conversions of up to 92% were obtained for pure lactose and 38% for raw lactose from whey. Surface-active properties including surface tension, interfacial tension, and contact angle were measured. All samples showed surface tensions lower than sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS (19.59-36.57 mN/m compared to 38.8 mN/m for SDS) and interfacial tensions comparable with it (9.47-12.18 mN/m compared to 4.77 mN/m for SDS). Results showed that aluminosilicate zeolites can be used for the synthesis of lactose esters, which have potential applications as biosurfactants for the food industry featuring low surface and interfacial tensions.

30611515|t|Variation patterns in the content of glycosides during green tea manufacturing by a modification-specific metabolomics approach: Enzymatic reaction promoting an increase in the glycosidically bound volatiles at the pan firing stage.
30611515|a|The glycosides are presumed to influence the quality of green tea but the molecular mechanism behind remains unclear. To elucidate the contribution of glycosides to the flavor formation of green tea, changes of both glycosidically bound non-volatiles (GBNVs) and glycosidically bound volatiles (GBVs) during the manufacturing of green tea were investigated using a modification-specific metabolomics method. A total of 64 glycosides (47 GBNVs and 17 GBVs) were identified and their contents mainly changed during the pan firing and drying stages of green tea manufacturing. Notably, the contents of GBVs significantly increased by 1.12-4.46-fold during pan firing. Correlation analysis showed that the GBVs contents were negatively related to the contents of volatiles and glucose. Model experiments revealed that enzymatic synthesis contributed to the increase in the content of GBVs during the pan firing. This comprehensive study on the glycosides changes revealed the molecular bases for GBVs increments during the pan firing.

30611516|t|Combined cereal and pulse flavonoids show enhanced bioavailability by downregulating phase II metabolism and ABC membrane transporter function in Caco-2 model.
30611516|a|Predominant flavonoids in cereals and pulses are structurally different and may positively interact to enhance bioactivity in combined diet. This work investigated the effects of combined cereal 3-deoxyflavonoids (apigenin, naringenin) and pulse flavonols (quercetin), along with natural extracts, on their bioavailability and underlying mechanisms using Caco-2 monolayer model. Membrane permeability, phase II metabolism, and ATP binding cassette (ABC) membrane transporter expression and function were measured. Apparent absorption of quercetin and apigenin increased (p &lt; 0.05) 3.3x and 1.5x, respectively, while both compounds were significantly less metabolized in combined treatments. Combinations with naringenin had insignificant effect, suggesting a role for flavonoid C2C3 conjugation. Both natural extracts and apigenin-quercetin combinations synergistically (3-40 fold) downregulated ABC transporter expression, and inhibited P-glycoprotein activity, suggesting direct binding and inhibition of ATPase. Combination of conjugated cereal and pulse flavonoids enhances their potential bioavailability through synergistic inhibition of membrane transporter and phase II enzyme function.

30613015|a|OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of cathepsin B in hepatic Kupffer cells (KCs) in activating Toll-like receptor 4(TLR- 4)-independent inflammatory pathways in mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. METHODS: Eighteen wild-type (WT) mice and 18 TLR4-knockout (TLR4-/-) mice were both divided into 3 groups for intraperitoneal injections of a lethal dose (54 mg/kg) of LPS, LPS and CA-074(a cathepsin B inhibitor), or normal saline, and the survival of the mice were observed. Another 36 WT mice and 36 TLR4-/-mice were also divided into 3 groups and subjected to intraperitoneal injections of normal saline, 20 mg/kg LPS, or LPS with CA-074 pretreatment.After the treatments, KCs were collected from the mice for assessing the protein level and activity of cathepsin B.The histopathological changes of the liver were observed with HE staining, and the serum levels of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-18 were detected. RESULTS: Compared with the WT mice,TLR4-/-mice receiving the lethal dose of LPS had significantly longer survival time (up to 84 h) after the injection,but were still unable to fully resist LPS challenge.CA-074 pretreatment prolonged the survival time of WT mice and TLR4-/-mice to 60 h and 132 h,respectively.In the mouse models of sepsis,20 mg/kg LPS induced significantly enhanced activity of cathepsin B without affecting its expression level in the KCs (P&amp;lt;0.05) and increased the serum levels of the inflammatory cytokines.CA-074 pretreatment of the mice obviously lessened the detrimental effects of LPS in TLR4-/-mice by significantly lowering cathepsin B activity in the KCs,alleviating hepatocyte apoptosis and reducing the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines. CONCLUSIONS: Cathepsin B plays an important role in activating TLR4-independent inflammatory pathways in mice with LPS-induced sepsis.

30621866|t|Molecular characterization of Listeria monocytogenes isolates from a small-scale meat processor in Montenegro, 2011-2014.
30621866|a|The presence of Listeria monocytogenes was evaluated in a small-scale meat processing facility in Montenegro during 2011-2014. L. monocytogenes isolates from traditional meat products and environmental swabs were subjected to a) molecular characterization b) serotyping by both multiplex PCR and next generation sequencing (NGS) c) potential antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was assessed by extraction of specific genes from NGS data and d) screening for the presence of some disinfectant resistance markers. Overall, traditional meat products were contaminated, most likely from incoming raw materials, with 4 major specific STs of L. monocytogenes (ST515, ST8, ST21, ST121) representing 4 clonal complexes (CC1, CC8, CC21, CC121) identified during the four-year period. These strains belonged to serogroup IIa which predominated, followed by IVb (ST515, CC1). The strains from environmental swabs belonged, exclusively, to ST21 and were isolated from cutting board and floor swabs in 2011. Furthermore, we found Tn6188, a novel transposon conferring tolerance to BC, to be specific to sequence type ST121. In addition, antimicrobial resistance genes mprF and fosX were present in clonal complexes CC21 and CC121, while complexes CC8 and CC1 exclusively harbored the mprF antimicrobial resistance gene.

30621871|t|Characterization of folate production and probiotic potential of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus CRL415.
30621871|a|Mandatory fortification of foods with folic acid is being questioned by many scientists principally because of the potential adverse secondary effects associated with their excessive consumption. It has been shown that selected strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are able to produce natural forms of folate and these could be included in foods to prevent deficiencies without causing adverse effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate folate production and fol gene expression by Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus (S. macedonicus) CRL415 under different growth conditions in vitro and to assess its potential probiotic application. Results showed that glucose as the principal carbon source, and incubation at 42  C under controlled pH conditions (6.0) increased folate production, fol gene expression, and growth of S. macedonicus CRL415. This strain was able to produce elevated folate concentrations during milk fermentation without the need of prolonged incubation times and was able to resist conditions simulating the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, S. macedonicus was susceptible to all required antibiotics, and had a good adhesion level to intestinal cells in vitro, making it a promising candidate for biotechnological application as functional starter cultures in the dairy industry.

30642509|t|Aroma compositions of large-leaf yellow tea and potential effect of theanine on volatile formation in tea.
30642509|a|Large-leaf yellow tea (LYT) imparting unique toasty flavor is a traditional beverage in China. The volatile composition of LYT after full fire processing (FF-YT) was determined by different extraction methods. Steam distillation (SD), solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and headspace (HS) were applied for analysis of tea body notes, tea infusion and dry tea aroma, respectively. A total of 143 volatile compounds was identified by the three methods, of which SD-FF-YT, SPME-FF-YT, and HS-FF-YT extracts contained 100, 72, and 56 volatiles, respectively. Heterocyclics and aromatic compounds were the main volatile composition of LYT and might be contributors to its crispy-rice-like odor. l-Theanine was demonstrated to contribute to the formation of tea volatiles. N-Ethylacetamide, formed in the l-theanine only model thermal reaction, was probably involved in the LYT volatile formation. The current results provide new insight into l-theanine on aroma formation, although the detailed formation mechanism remains largely unknown.

30642511|t|HS-SPME-GC-MS/olfactometry combined with chemometrics to assess the impact of germination on flavor attributes of chickpea, lentil, and yellow pea flours.
30642511|a|In this study, volatile component changes of germinated chickpea, lentil, and yellow pea flours over the course of 6 days germination were characterized by HS-SPME-GC-MS/O. In total, 124 volatile components were identified involving 19 odor active components being recorded by GC-O exclusively. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) revealed that lentil and yellow pea flours had the similar aromatic attributes, while the decrease of beany flavor compounds along with the occurrence of unpleasant flavors was detected in chickpea flours upon germination. Six beany flavor markers, including hexanal, (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal, (E,E)-2,4-decadienal, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 1-hexanol, and 2-pentyl-furan, were employed to quantify beany flavor formation in the flours over the course of germination. The results suggested that no significant beany flavor formation or mitigation was appeared after 1 day of germination. The findings are crucial for tailing pulse germination process to enhance the macronutrients without increasing undesirable beany flavor.

30658742|t|Comparative studies on ACE inhibition, degree of hydrolysis, antioxidant property and phenolic acid composition of hydrolysates derived from simulated in vitro gastrointestinal proteolysis of three thermally treated legumes.
30658742|a|Three phenolic-rich legume varieties underwent in vitro simulated gastrointestinal proteolytic digestion after a wide range of thermal treatments. Total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH free radical scavenging activity (DPPH), degree of hydrolysis (DH), angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of hydrolysates showed significant differences among thermal treatments. TPC values of hydrolysates were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher than their corresponding undigested counterparts. The DPPH values were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower than their corresponding undigested counterparts. DH had no correlations (p &gt; 0.05) with ACE inhibitory activity for all three legumes. When compared with undigested legumes, the simulated gastrointestinal tract proteolytic digestion induced marked changes not only in the content, but also in the type of individual free phenolic acids. The present study clearly implied that literature data of phenolics and their potential health benefits derived from undigested legumes cannot accurately represent the real situations after the digestion process.

30658746|t|Effects of sodium tripolyphosphate modification on the structural, functional, and rheological properties of rice glutelin.
30658746|a|In this study, rice glutelin isolated from glutinous rice was modified by sodium tripolyphosphate at different sodium tripolyphosphate concentrations (1%, 4%, 7%). The structural, functional and rheological properties of phosphorylated rice glutelin were investigated. The results indicated that phosphorylated rice glutelin samples showed small particle size and high absolute zeta potential values. Phosphorylation reaction was occurred between -OH and -NH2 groups in rice glutelin and sodium tripolyphosphate, as confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The particle surface of phosphorylated rice glutelin samples became very rough and exhibited some small convex and concave holes. Moreover, the solubility, emulsifying and foaming properties, thermal stability and apparent viscosity of phosphorylated rice glutelin samples were significantly increased. These results suggest that the solubility, emulsification and rheological properties of rice glutelin are significantly improved after phosphorylation, which will be beneficial to expand the application of rice glutelin in food industry.

30658754|t|Effects of sucrose and copigment sources on the major anthocyanins isolated from sour cherries.
30658754|a|Cyanidin-3-O-glucosylrutinoside and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside were isolated from sour cherry juice concentrate (SCJC). Sucrose and copigments [gallic acid (GA), cherry stem extract (CSE) and pomegranate rind extract (PRE)] were added to these anthocyanins. Effects of sucrose and copigments on the isolated anthocyanins were studied during storage at 20  C for 140 days. All copigment sources provided protection against degradation effect of sucrose on the isolated anthocyanins before storage. Although GA increased the stabilities of both isolated anthocyanins, only CSE had copigmentation effect on both isolated anthocyanins. Copigmentation effect on cyanidin-3-O-glucosylrutinoside continued throughout storage. However, this effect on cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside continued for only 56 days of storage. Cyanidin-3-O-glucosylrutinoside containing three sugar moieties was more prone to copigmentation than cyanidine-3-rutinoside containing two sugar moieties. Results showed that the presence of more than one anthocyanin in a media changed stability of copigmentation. We recommend CSE for enhancement in colour density, but GA for enhancement in anthocyanin stability.

30658758|t|Characterization of binding interactions of anthraquinones and bovine beta-lactoglobulin.
30658758|a|Anthraquinones, a class of naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds, exhibit a wide range of bioactivities. However, most free anthraquinones are lipophilic bioactive compounds. Bovine beta-lactoglobulin (betaLG), a major whey protein, has a high affinity for small hydrophobic compounds. In this study, the interactions between anthraquinones (rhein, emodin, and chrysophanol) and betaLG were investigated by using fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and docking studies. These anthraquinones bound to the site near Trp19-Arg124 on betaLG with a binding constant (Ka) between 103 and 105 L mol-1 to form complexes, which changed the secondary structure of betaLG, inducing an alpha-helix to beta-sheet structure transition. The order of binding increased with an increasing polarity in the order of rhein &gt; emodin &gt; chrysophanol. In addition, the degree of radical scavenging capacity masking increased with an increasing binding affinity. Complexation with betaLG significantly increases the hydrosolubility of anthraquinones.

30658760|t|Impact of human milk pasteurization on the kinetics of peptide release during in vitro dynamic digestion at the preterm newborn stage.
30658760|a|Holder pasteurization (62.5  C, 30 min) of human milk denatures beneficial proteins. The present paper aimed to assess whether this can affect the kinetics of peptide release during digestion at the preterm stage. Raw (RHM) or pasteurized (PHM) human milk were digested in triplicates using an in vitro dynamic system. Mass spectrometry and multivariate statistics were conducted. Pre-proteolysis occurred mostly on beta-casein, for which cumulative peptide abundance was significantly greater in PHM over 28% of the hydrolysed sequence. Eight clusters resumed the kinetics of peptide release during digestion, which differed on seven clusters (69% of the 1134 peptides). Clusters associated to the heat-denaturated proteins, lactoferrin and bile salt-stimulated lipase, presented different kinetics of release during digestion, unlike that for beta-casein. Some bioactive peptides from beta-casein presented significant different abundances between PHM and RHM before digestion (1-18, 185-211) or in during intestinal digestion (154-160, 161-166). Further physiological consequences should be investigated.

30682765|t|Transfer of a cyanobacterial neurotoxin, beta-methylamino-l-alanine from soil to crop and its bioaccumulation in Chinese cabbage.
30682765|a|Most cyanobacteria can synthesize the notorious neurotoxin beta-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) that is transferred and bioaccumulated through natural food webs of aquatic ecosystems and ultimately arises the potential human health risks by the consumption of BMAA-contaminated aquatic products. Fertilization of cyanobacterial composts in farmlands may also lead to BMAA contamination in soil and its possible transfer and bioaccumulation within major crops, thereby threatening human health. In this study, we first detected a high level of BMAA (1.8-16.3 mug g-1) in cyanobacterial composts. In order to assess the health risks from cyanobacterial composts, we planted Chinese cabbage, a favourite vegetable in China, in BMAA-contaminated soil (4.0 mug BMAA/g soil) and detected the levels of free and protein-associated BMAA in soil and crop organs during the whole growth cycle by HPLC-MS/MS, respectively. Our results demonstrated that BMAA indeed transferred from soil to root, stem and leaf of Chinese cabbage during the growth cycle. The BMAA level finally accumulated in the edible portions was much higher than the initial level in soil, including 13.82 mug g-1 in leaf and 4.71 mug g-1 in stem. The discovery of the neurotoxin BMAA in this vegetable, an ending in human consumption, not only provides a BMAA transfer pathway in farmland ecosystems, but also is alarming and requires attention due to the potential risk of cyanobacterial composts to human health.

30683372|t|An enzyme-free sensitive electrochemical microRNA-16 biosensor by applying a multiple signal amplification strategy based on Au/PPy-rGO nanocomposite as a substrate.
30683372|a|In present study, a sensitive and effective electrochemical microRNA (miRNA) sensing platform is successfully developed by integrating gold nanoparticles/polypyrrole-reduced graphene oxide (Au/PPy-rGO), catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) and hybridization chain reaction (HCR) multiple signal amplification strategy. Firstly, Au/PPy-rGO was employed onto a bare GCE by electrodeposition that can greatly enhanced conductivity and effectively immobilize probes. Then, the thiolated capture probes (SH-CP) were self-assembled on the Au/PPy-rGO modified GCE via Au-S bond. The target miRNA triggered the dynamic assembly of the two hairpin substrates (H1 and H2), leading to the cyclicality of the target miRNA and the formation of H1-H2 complexes without the assistance of enzyme. Subsequently, the newly emerging DNA fragment of H2 triggered the HCR when a mixture solution (hairpins H3 and H4) and produced dsDNA polymers. Finally, a substantial amount of methylene blue (MB) as signal indicator was intercalated into the minor groove of the long dsDNA polymers to achieve detected electrochemical signal. The fabricated sensor is able to detect miRNA-16 (model target) with concentration range from 10 fM to 5 nM with a low detection limit (LOD) of 1.57 fM (S/N = 3). Current research suggests that the developed multiple signal amplification platform has a great potential for the applications in the field of biomedical research and clinical analysis.

30683396|t|The peroxidase-mimicking function of acetate and its application in single-enzyme-based glucose test paper.
30683396|a|Acetate ion was widely used in pH buffer to control pH environment. Here we firstly found that acetate ion had mimic peroxidase activity. Acetate ions are capable of catalyzing the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and play a similar role to that of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Acetate catalyzes the oxidation of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by H2O2, which is the product of the reaction of glucose and glucose oxidase. A colorimetric sensor for H2O2 and glucose was developed using acetate ions. The linear regression equation for H2O2 was A = 0.0029 C + 0.0530 (C (mumolL-1), R = 0.9978), and the detection limit was 3.0 mumolL-1, whereas that for glucose was A = 0.0021 C + 0.0709 (C (mumol L-1), R = 0.9977), and the detection limit was 4.0 mumol L-1. Moreover, the proposed method was successfully applied for the detection of H2O2 in human urine and glucose in human serum; thus, the proposed method could be used for the diagnosis of illness or disease. A single-enzyme-based glucose test paper was firstly prepared and tested for semi-quantitative analysis of glucose.

30683409|t|Differential diagnosis of multielements in cancerous and non-cancerous esophageal tissues.
30683409|a|It is known that variations in the concentrations of certain elements in humans may be an indication of cancers. In this work, a method for the quantitative analysis of 22 elements in non-tumor and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues from the same individual is reported. Based on the optimized platform combined with multivariate analysis, diagnostic models of ESCC were established using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), showing excellent classification of cancerous and non-cancerous group by metallomic profiling. Elemental concentrations of 10 elements (Mn, Se, Cu, Ti, Mg, Fe, Co, Zn, Sr, Ca) showed significant difference (p &lt; 0.001) in tumor and non-tumor tissues, in which Mn, Se, Cu and Ti are the top 4 elements of statistical significance and a shift towards higher concentration levels has also been observed in the tumor samples. These results confirm the considerable potential of elemental studies for biomedical purposes. To our knowledge, previous studies on elemental concentration in esophageal cancer were performed in serum or plasma levels; and this is the first study to evaluate the association of tissue elemental concentrations with ESCC.

30683818|t|The cyclooxygenase-2/prostaglandin E2 pathway and its role in the pathogenesis of human and dog hematological malignancies.
30683818|a|The overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been documented in many types of cancer occurring in humans and animals. Increasing evidences have shown that the overexpression of COX-2 and increased production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) correlate with poor prognosis in human solid tumours and hematological malignancies. Both, in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that increased proliferation of cancer cells as well as an impairment of anti-tumour immunity are influenced by the overexpression of this enzyme. In leukemia and lymphoma, an increased activity of COX-2 and subsequent increase in prostaglandins (PGs) concentration allow cancer cells to evade immune response and contribute to metastases. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) in tumour microenvironment, suppression of innate and adaptive immunity depends on COX-2/PGE22 axis activity which increases in hematological malignancies. Cyclooxygenases inhibitors block the formation of PGs, consequently inhibiting angiogenesis, and in some malignancies they decrease cancer cells proliferation and tumour invasiveness. They also increase apoptosis of CSCs and cancer cells, decrease their drug resistance as well as enhance the host immune response. Therefore COX-2/PGE2 axis suppressors: selective COX-2 inhibitors or PG receptors antagonists have been considered as promising anticancer drugs. In comparative oncology dogs are increasingly used as a large animal model because they share the same environmental conditions with people and are exposed to the same environmental factors and also due to their relatively short life span. In dogs, spontaneously occurring non-Hodgkin lymphomas and leukemias have a large number of genetic and morphological features that are similar to those of humans' corresponding cancers. This, additionally makes the species a useful model for the study of new therapeutic strategies in human oncology. While the influence of COX-2 activity and PGE2 receptors have been evaluated extensively in human cancer, their role in veterinary oncology still needs to be elucidated.

30683822|t|Lipopolysaccharide-induced redistribution of myocardial connexin43 is associated with increased macrophage infiltration in both normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats.
30683822|a|We investigated whether changes in gap junction alpha-1 protein (Cx43) expression may be associated with macrophage-induced inflammation in the heart of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). To examine mutual interactions of macrophage infiltration with Cx43 expression and redistribution, we applied a bolus of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to SHR and age-matched normotensive Wistar rats. The results demonstrated association of Cx43 downregulation with increased infiltration of cardiac CD-68 macrophages and upregulation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression in the heart of SHR. LPS application to SHR caused further degradation and redistribution of Cx43 accompanied with extensively increased macrophage infiltration and NFkappaB and TNF-alpha expression. LPS administration to Wistar rats resulted in elevation of cardiac CD-68 macrophages but it did not significantly affect total Cx43 expression. Our results are suggestive of regulation of Cx43 expression with macrophages-related inflammation in the heart of SHR. The data also indicate that SHR can be more sensitive to LPS than are normotensive rats.

30683827|t|Host nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 defense system determines the outcome of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice.
30683827|a|Administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water led to significant bout of colitis simulating ulcerative colitis of human. However, colitis usually developed 5 - 7 days after DSS administration. Therefore, we hypothesized host defense system might protect colitis up to 5 days of DSS administration. 2.5% DSS-induced colitis were administered to C57BL/6 mice and sequential measurements of pathology, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NADPH quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), and keap1 were done at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 120, and 168 hour of DSS administration, respectively. DSS-induced colitis was repeated in either COX-2-/- or Nrf2-/- mice. On serial pathological analysis, significant colitis was noted after 120 h of DSS administration, during which both activations of COX-2/NF-kappaB and HO-1/Nrf2 were noted. Nrf2 activations after keap1 inactivation led to significant increases in HO-1 after 168 hours of DSS administration, when NF-kappaB nuclear translocation was noted. Significantly attenuated colitis was noted in DSS-challenged COX-2-/- mice, in which the levels of HO-1 were significantly decreased compared to DSS-challenged WT littermates (p &lt; 0.01), while the levels of NQO1 were significantly increased. On DSS administration to Nrf2-/- mice, colitis was significantly aggravated (p &lt; 0.01), in which the expressions of COX-2 as well as expressions of HO-1 and gamma-GCS were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.01). Reciprocal activations of inflammatory and antioxidative defense signaling after DSS administration might be prerequisite to make intestinal homeostasis and host defense Nrf2 system can determine colitis.

30683831|t|Oral supplements of combined fructo- and xylo-oligosaccharides during perinatal period significantly offsets acrylamide-induced oxidative impairments and neurotoxicity in rats.
30683831|a|Fetal and early childhood exposure to low levels of chemicals formed in foods during heating, especially acrylamide (ACR) is of increased concern due to developmental neurotoxicity. The neurodevelopment during perinatal period is critical and evidence suggests that the gut microbiota plays a major role in shaping brain development and behavior. Pregnant Wistar rats provided with oral supplements a combination of fructo- and xylo-oligosaccharides (FOS + XOS, 3 g/kg/day) from gestation day 0 (GD 0) to postnatal day 21 (PND 21) were exposed to ACR (100 ppm, GD 6 to PND 21) in drinking water. While ACR exposure caused a significant reduction in the maternal gestational/ lactational body weight, preweaning body weights and behavioral alterations among male offspring, combination supplement of FOS + XOS had no significant effect. However, significantly diminished antioxidant enzyme (SOD and CAT) activities in the maternal and offspring brain were restored among rats given FOS + XOS supplementation. The prebiotic supplementation normalized elevated nitric oxide levels in the cerebellum of the offspring born to ACR exposed rats. Furthermore, prebiotics restored the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and improved the levels of dopamine (DA) in the maternal cortex. The protective effect of prebiotic supplementation was also discernible in the mitochondrial fraction of maternal brain regions. These findings suggest that prebiotic supplementation during pregnancy may be useful in attenuating the perinatal toxic effects associated with neurotoxin exposure.

30685586|t|Biosynthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles using leaf extract of Ruellia tuberosa: Antimicrobial properties and their applications in photocatalytic degradation.
30685586|a|Green synthesis of nanoparticles is one of the promising, ecofriendly and safer methods. Utilizing plant sources as reducing agents will replace the use of toxic chemicals for nanoparticle synthesis. In the present study FeONPs were synthesized using Ruellia tuberosa (RT) leaf aqueous extract, further characterization of FeONPs was performed using UV-vis spectroscopy analysis showing visible peak at 405 nm. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) proved the presence of Fe metallic ions. The structural characteristic using Field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (FESEM-EDX) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed hexagonal nanorods with agglomeration. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) calculated the average size of FeONPs around 52.78 nm and differential scanning colorimetry (DSC) proved the stability of FeONPs till higher temperature of 165.52  C. As an application part, the synthesized FeONPs showed potential antibacterial activity as individual and incorporating material over cotton fabrics against Gram negative and Gram positive pathogens. FeONPs showed higher antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and lesser antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. The photocatalytic ability of the synthesized FeONPs was demonstrated by the degrading crystal violet dye under solar irradiation upto 80%. Thus, FeONPs synthesized using Ruellia tuberosa could play a vital role in killing the bacterial pathogens and degrading dye for the bioremediation of wastewater from industrial and domestic sources.

30686450|t|Essential element Cu and non-essential element Hg exposures have different toxicological effects in the liver of large yellow croaker.
30686450|a|The objective was to compare the different effects of essential element Cu and non-essential element Hg on antioxidant and inflammatory responses in the liver of large yellow croaker Larimichthys crocea. Fish were exposed to Cu stresses (72 and 288 mug L-1) and Hg stresses (14 and 56 mug L-1) for 96 h. High-dose Cu increased metallothioneins (MTs) levels and immune defenses in response to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), but low-dose Cu had no effect on ROS. High-dose Hg reduced antioxidant and inflammatory responses, which contributed to the increment of ROS. MTs may be a suitable biomarker to assess Cu contamination, but no relationship was observed between MTs levels and Hg content. Furthermore, NFE2-related nuclear factor 2 (Nrf2) and nuclear transcription factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) were positively related to their respective target genes in the Cu-exposed groups. In conclusion, Cu and Hg induced some differences in antioxidant and inflammatory responses, which providing some novel insights into toxicological effects of Cu and Hg stresses.

30691637|t|Genotypic differences in agro-physiological, biochemical and isotopic responses to salinity stress in quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) plants: Prospects for salinity tolerance and yield stability.
30691637|a|Quinoa is an important nutritive crop that can play a strategic role in the development of marginal and degraded lands. Genotypic variations in carbon isotope composition (delta13C), carbon isotope discrimination (Delta13C), ratio of intercellular to atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ci/Ca), intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE), seed yield and grain protein contents were analyzed in 6 quinoa cultivars grown in the field under saline conditions (0, 10, 20 dS m-1). Significant variations occurred in dry biomass, seed yield, plant height, number of branches, number of panicles, panicle weight, harvest index, N and C content. Some genotypes produced yields with values significantly higher than 2.04 t ha-1 (Q12), with an average increased to 2.58 t ha-1 (AMES22157). The present study indicates a large variation in Delta13C for salinity treatments (3.43%) and small magnitude of variations among genotypes (0.95%). Results showed that Delta might be used as an important index for screening, and selection of the salt tolerant quinoa genotypes with high iWUE. Quinoa genotypes differs in foliar 13C and 15N isotope composition, which reflected complex interactions of salinity and plant carbon and nitrogen metabolisms. Grain protein contents were found higher in Q19 and Q31 and lowest in Q26. The study demonstrates that AMES22157 and Q12, were salt tolerant and high yielder while the AMES22157 was more productive. This study provides a reliable measure of morpho-physiological, biochemical and isotopic responses of quinoa cultivars to salinity in hyper arid UAE climate and it may be valuable in the future breeding programs. The development of genotypes having both higher water use efficiency and yield potential would be a very useful contribution for producers in the dry region of Arabian Peninsula.

30693063|t|Xylanase and Fermented Polysaccharide of Hericium caputmedusae Reduce Pathogenic Infection of Broilers by Improving Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Properties.
30693063|a|Background: Pathogenic infection in broilers has become an important issue in the development of poultry industry. Xylooligosaccharides released from xylan via xylanase and fermented polysaccharide of Hericium caputmedusae (FPHC) have antimicrobial potential against many pathogens. Objective: We aimed to explore the effects of xylanase and FPHC on pathogenic infection in the broilers (Gallus gallus domesticus). Methods: Three hundred and thirty 21-day male broilers were assigned into four groups: control group (CG, basic diet), xylanase group (XG, basic diet + xylanase), FPHC group (HG, basic diet + FPHC), and XHG group (basic diet + xylanase + FPHC). Average daily feed intake (ADFI) and daily gain (ADG) were measured. Microflora from broiler feces was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Serum tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) alpha, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-10, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were detected using kits. The variables were compared using the Student t-test between two groups. Results: Microbiological investigations showed that 75% of broilers were affected by bacterial pathogens in the CG group, most notably by coagulase-negative staphylococci. Comparatively, 15%, 26%, and 5% of broilers were affected by bacterial pathogens in the XG, HG, and XHG groups, respectively. Xylanase and FPHC treatment increased the ratio of ADG to ADFI and antioxidant capacity by increasing the levels of T-AOC, SOD, and GSH-Px and reducing the levels of MDA (P &lt; 0.05). Xylanase and FPHC treatment improved anti-inflammatory capacity by increasing serum levels of IL-1ra and IL-10 and reducing the levels of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. On the other hand, the treatment increased probiotic concentration of Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis, and Lactobacillus plantarum (P &lt; 0.05), which were also proved in cell culture. Conclusions: Xylanase and FPHC ameliorate pathogen infection by increasing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of broilers via the increase of probiotics.

30704714|t|Neonicotinoid insecticides mode of action on insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors using binding studies.
30704714|a|Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are the main target of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are widely used in crop protection against insect pests. Electrophysiological and molecular approaches have demonstrated the presence of several nAChR subtypes with different affinities for neonicotinoid insecticides. However, the precise mode of action of neonicotinoids on insect nAChRs remains to be elucidated. Radioligand binding studies with [3H]-alpha-bungarotoxin and [3H]-imidacloprid have proved instructive in understanding ligand binding interactions between insect nAChRs and neonicotinoid insecticides. The precise binding site interactions have been established using membranes from whole body and specific tissues. In this review, we discuss findings concerning the number of nAChR binding sites against neonicotinoid insecticides from radioligand binding studies on native tissues. We summarize the data available in the literature and compare the binding properties of the most commonly used neonicotinoid insecticides in several insect species. Finally, we demonstrate that neonicotinoid-nAChR binding sites are also linked to biological samples used and insect species.

30704719|t|Identification and interaction of multiple genes resulting in DDT resistance in the 91-R strain of Drosophila melanogaster by RNAi approaches.
30704719|a|4,4'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) has been re-recommended by the World Health Organization for malaria mosquito control. Previous DDT use has resulted in resistance, and with continued use resistance will likely increase in terms of level and extent. Drosophila melanogaster is a model dipteran with a well annotated genome allowing both forward and reverse genetic manipulation, numerous studies done on insecticide resistance mechanisms, and is related to malaria mosquitoes allowing for extrapolation. The 91-R strain of D. melanogaster is highly resistant to DDT (&gt;1500-fold) and recently, reduced penetration, increased detoxification, and direct excretion have been identified as resistance mechanisms. Their interactions, however, remain unclear. Use of Gal4/UAS-RNAi transgenic lines of D. melanogaster allowed for the targeted knockdown of genes putatively involved in DDT resistance and has identified the role of several cuticular proteins (Cyp4g1 and Lcp1), cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (Cyp6g1 and Cyp12d1), and ATP binding cassette transporters (Mdr50, Mdr65, and Mrp1) involved in decreased sensitivity to DDT. These above findings have been further validated in 91-R flies using a nanoparticle-enhanced RNAi strategy, directly implication these genes in DDT resistance in 91-R flies.

30710774|t|Exploration of nitrate-to-glutamate assimilation in non-photosynthetic roots of higher plants by studies of 15N-tracing, enzymes involved, reductant supply, and nitrate signaling: A review and synthesis.
30710774|a|Roots of the higher plants can assimilate inorganic nitrogen by an enzymatic reduction of the most oxidized form (+6) nitrate to the reduced form (-2) glutamate. For such reactions, the substrates (originated from photosynthates) must be imported to supply energy through the reductant-generating systems within the root cells. Intensive studies over last 70 years (reviewed here) revealed the precise mechanisms of nitrate-to-glutamate transformation in roots with elaborate searches of 15N-tracing, enzymes involved, the reductant-supplying system, and nitrate signaling. In the 1970s, the tracing of 15N-labeled nitrate and ammonia in the roots demonstrated the sequential reduction and assimilation of nitrate to nitrite, ammonia, glutamine amide, and then glutamate. These reactions involve nitrate reductase (NADH-NR, EC 1.7.1.1) in the cytosol, nitrite reductase (ferredoxin [Fd]-NiR, EC 1.7.7.1), glutamine synthetase (GS2, EC 6.3.1.2), and glutamate synthase (Fd-GOGAT, EC 1.4.7.1) in the plastids. NADH for NR is generated by glycolysis in the cytosol, and NADPH for Fd-NIR and Fd-GOGAT are produced by the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP). Electrons from NADPH are conveyed to reduce NIR and Fd-GOGAT through Fd-NADP+ reductase (FNR, EC 1.6.7.1) specifically in the roots. Physiological and molecular analyses showed the parallel inductions of NR, NIR, GS2, Fd-GOGAT, OPPP enzymes, FNR, and Fd in response to a short-term nitrate supply. Recent studies proposed a molecular mechanism of nitrate-induction of these genes and proteins. Roots can also assimilate the reduced form of inorganic ammonia by the combination of cytosolic GS1 and plastidic NADH-GOGAT.

30711101|t|Effect of jet milling on the physicochemical properties, pasting properties, and in vitro starch digestibility of germinated brown rice flour.
30711101|a|Germinated brown rice (GBR) flours were prepared by hammer milling and jet milling. The effect of the milling on the physicochemical and pasting properties of the resultant flours were investigated. The jet milling of GBR resulted in flour with different particle sizes, which were air-classified into coarse and fine size fractions. As the particle size decreased, the amount of damaged starch increased. The WAI, WSI, and oil absorption of the jet-milled GBR flour was slightly lower than that of the hammer-milled flour. Increased alpha- and beta-amylase activities were observed in the coarse fraction of the jet-milled GBR flour compared with the hammer-milled and jet-milled fine fractions. The RVA viscosity profiles of the fine fraction of the jet-milled GBR flour were significantly higher than those of the hammer-milled or the coarse fraction of the jet-milled GBR flour. Compared with the hammer-milled flour, jet milling increased in vitro starch hydrolysis.

30712551|t|Preoperative tyrosine kinase inhibitors risks bowel anastomotic healing in patients with advanced primary and recurrent/metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors--- A rose has its thorns.
30712551|a|BACKGROUND: The combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and surgery has created a paradigm shift for advanced primary and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). However, the associated surgical morbidity rate is reportedly high, which we hypothesized is attributable to the adverse effects of the previous use of TKIs on bowel anastomosis healing. METHODS: A total of 613 GIST patients with (n = 108) and without (n = 505) preoperative TKI treatment were enrolled. Propensity score matching compared the surgical morbidities and mortalities between the two cohorts. An animal model was used to elucidate the relevant mechanism. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, the incidence and severity of surgical complications were higher in patients with preoperative TKIs than in those without (34% vs 10%, p &lt; 0.0001; grades 3-5, 16% vs 2%, p &lt; 0.0001). Specifically, the incidence of bowel anastomosis leakage was increased in those with versus those without preoperative TKI (18% vs 6%, p = 0.032). A constellation of mucosal shedding, shortening of villus height and crypt depth, and disarrayed epithelial lining of the bowel was observed with preoperative TKI treatment. The animal model showed that bowel anastomosis healing was weakened by imatinib through the downregulation of Col1A1, Col3A1, and MMPs. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired bowel anastomosis healing was responsible for the extraordinarily high surgical morbidity rate of patients with GIST after TKI treatment. The mechanism involved altered tissue microarchitecture and dysregulated Col1A1, Col3A1, and MMP expressions.

30712583|t|Double-integrated mimic enzymes for the visual screening of Microcystin-LR: Copper hydroxide nanozyme and G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme.
30712583|a|Recently, mimic enzymes have obtained particular interest by their high activity, stability, and biocompatibility. In this work, by coupling copper hydroxide nanozyme and G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzyme to form a double-integrated mimic enzyme, a visual, sensitive and selective immunosensor was established to detect microcystin-LR (MC-LR). In this immunoassay, the microplates were modified with core-shell silica/nickel silicate as the substrate to capture MC-LR antigens. Then, Cu(OH)2 nanocages with fine regulation were used as the label to capture the secondary antibody for immunoreaction and the DNA primer for propagation, followed by using hybridization chain reaction to amplify the DNA primer, thus numerous DNAzymes (G-quadruplex/hemin) can be formed on the surface of Cu(OH)2 nanocages with the aid of hemin. Such double-integrated mimic enzyme including Cu(OH)2 nanozymes and DNAzymes showed excellent peroxidase activity for the chromogenic reaction of 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), which realized the visual detection of MC-LR in the range from 0.007 to 75 mug/L with the detection limit of 6 ng/mL, and thus provided the probability for the portable assessment of MC-LR in real sample.

30712585|t|Mustard seeds derived fluorescent carbon quantum dots and their peroxidase-like activity for colorimetric detection of H2O2 and ascorbic acid in a real sample.
30712585|a|Herein, we were synthesized fluorescent carbon quantum dots via facile one-step hydrothermal treatment of mustard seeds (M-CQDs). It showed excellent optical property with fluorescent quantum yield 4.6%. The as-prepared M-CQDs exhibited peroxidase-like mimetic activity and catalyzed the oxidation of chromogenic substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of H2O2 to produce a blue color reaction mixture with the prominent peak at 652 nm. Furthermore, the peroxidase-like catalytic performance of M-CQDs followed the steady-state kinetics behavior and exhibited similar catalytic activity as that of natural enzyme Horseradish peroxidase (HRP). In addition to this, the double reciprocal plot showed a parallel line which suggested the occurrence of Ping-Pong type of mechanism. The H2O2 dependent oxidation of TMB was helpful for the colorimetric detection of H2O2 in the linear range of 0.02-0.20 mM with the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.015 mM. Interestingly, the oxidized TMB (ox-TMB) was further reduced to native TMB by the reducing agent ascorbic acid. Hence M-CQDs showed its potential towards the selective and sensitive detection of ascorbic acid in the linear range of 10-70 muM having a correlation coefficient of 0.998 with LOD of 3.26 muM. The practical feasibility of the proposed detection method of AA was also investigated in common fresh fruits.

30712592|t|Magnetic gamma-cyclodextrin polymer with compatible cavity promote the magnetic solid-phase extraction of microcystins in water samples.
30712592|a|Microcystins (MCs), which are produced by eruptive cyanobacteria, seriously threaten the health of humans for their poisonousness. Herein, a facile strategy was introduced to synthesize the magnetic gamma-cyclodextrin polymer (Fe3O4@PDA@gamma-CDP) composite and set it as a novel adsorbent with excellent properties for the magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) of MCs. The prepared Fe3O4@PDA@gamma-CDP microspheres exhibit good aqueous dispersibility and highly affinity for MCs, thus contribute to an excellent extraction performance for trace MCs in water samples. Combined with HPLC-MS/MS, a handy, sensitive and efficient method was developed for detection of MCs in water samples, which shows good linearity (R2 &gt;= 0.9992) in the range of 1.0-1000 pg mL-1, low limits of detection (0.8-2.0 pg mL-1, S/N = 3), satisfactory repeatability with the relative standard deviations (RSDs) lower than 6.2% (n = 5). At last, the proposed method was successfully applied for the extraction and detection of MCs in fresh water and sea water samples, which provides great potential of trace-level MCs determination in lake and sea water.

30712596|t|Derivatization enhances analysis of estrogens and their bioactive metabolites in human plasma by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.
30712596|a|Estrogens regulate many diverse biological processes in health and disease. They circulate at a wide range of concentrations in females generating several active metabolites (hydroxy and methoxyestrogens). The metabolites are assumed to be present in much lower levels and are thought to contribute to diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Estrogen metabolites are challenging to quantify in plasma and currently available immunoassays are non-specific. Here we have developed and validated a novel assay to simultaneously quantify parent estrogens and their metabolites by mass spectrometry (MS). Estrogens were extracted from human plasma using solid phase extraction and derivatized using 1-(5-fluoro-2, 4-dinitrophenyl)-4-methylpiperazine (PPZ) before quaternization by methylation ("MPPZ"). MPPZ derivatives were separated and quantified by liquid chromatography tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) in positive electrospray ionization mode, using a QTrap 6500 + coupled to a Shimadzu Nexera X2. Separation was achieved using an ACE Excel 2 C18-PFP column (2 mum, 2.1 mm x 150 mm). The limits of quantification (LOQ) were 0.43-2.17 pg on column with a linear range from 2 or 10 - 2000 pg mL-1. Intra and inter-day precision and accuracy were acceptable (&lt;20% at LOQ and &lt;15% above). These derivatives demonstrated minimal degradation upon short-term storage at 15  C (&lt;20%) and longer term at -20  C (&lt;20%). Using this approach, estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) were detected in plasma (0.5 mL) from healthy women and those with PAH but downstream metabolites 16-hydroxy-E1, 16-hydroxy-E2, 2-methoxy-E1 and 4-methoxy-E1 were only detected in plasma from diseased patients. These findings will next be tested robustly in large patient cohorts. This novel LC-MS/MS analysis of estrogens and their bioactive metabolites, using MPPZ derivatization, opens doors for the simultaneous analysis of a panel of estrogens in human plasma, across the endogenous range of concentrations encountered in health and disease.

30724222|t|Mapping the location of DATEM in multi-phase systems: Synthesis and characterization of spin-label probe analogues.
30724222|a|Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy has emerged as a fast, reliable, non-invasive and sensitive method to determine the distribution, localization and reactivity of labelled ingredients in micro-heterogeneous systems. However, the commercially available probe molecules are very limited. In the present work, five new nitroxide [(4-hydroxy-2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPOL)] derivatives (1b-5b) of diacetyl tartaric acid esters of monoglycerides (DATEM) (1a-5a), a widely used food emulsifier, were synthesized under Steglich conditions and characterized by MS (mass-spectrometry), FT-IR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy), EPR, NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy), fluorescence spectroscopy, and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) analysis. Phase partitioning studies proved that the new spin labels are adequately capable of describing the localizations and partitioning of the corresponding DATEM in multi-phase systems. Findings disclosed in this work will provide new knowledge on ingredient reactivity and localization in multi-phase systems; which is vital to aid the design of more efficient delivery systems for bioactive compounds.

30724260|t|Comparison of concentration and health risks of 9 Fusarium mycotoxins in commercial whole wheat flour and refined wheat flour by multi-IAC-HPLC.
30724260|a|Multiple mycotoxins can contaminate foods simultaneously leading to increased risks for human health. To assess exposure and health risks of 9 mycotoxins, we employed a multiple immunoaffinity column - high performance liquid chromatography method to determine their concentrations of 35 whole wheat flour and 50 refined wheat flour samples from China. The recoveries of the validated method were 75.78-118.24%, and the limits of detection and quantification were 1.5-20 and 5.0-60 microg kg-1, respectively. Multiple mycotoxins were detected in 37.1% of whole wheat flour and 8% of refined wheat flour. In the worst-case scenario, the hazard index was 222.69% for male and 253.97% for female with a cumulative exposure to Fusarium mycotoxins through consuming whole wheat flour, and deoxynivalenol was the main mycotoxin detected. In conclusion, whole wheat flour should be regarded with more health concern because of cumulative effects of co-occurred mycotoxins.

30725063|t|[Detection of mutations of the HNF1B gene in children with congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract].
30725063|a|INTRODUCTION: Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract are caused by genetic alterations mostly unknown. Mutations in the gene that codes for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1B (HNF1B) are the most frequently described monogenic causes. Data are unknown in Chile and Latin America. OBJECTIVE: To determine the presence of variants of the HNF1B gene in Chilean children with conge nital anomalies of the kidney and/or the urinary tract and their clinical characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Descriptive study with children aged 10 months to 17 years, patients of the Calvo Mackenna Hospital Nephrology Unit, with cystic renal dysplasia, non cystic renal dysplasia/hypoplasia, horses hoe kidney between April and December 2016. HNF1B variants were determined by sequencing of exons 1, 2, 3 and 4 after DNA extraction and amplification. Restriction enzymes were used to define if the variants were homo or heterozygous. Direct family members of index cases were studied with sequencing of the affected exon. RESULTS: 32 patients were included, 43.75% males, median age 11 years. 65.6% of them had non-cystic renal dysplasia, 31.25% cystic renal dysplasia, and 3.15% hor seshoe kidney. In two patients (6.25%) the same heterozygous genetic variant was detected in exon 4, position 1027 (C1027T), not previously described. The study of relatives found the same variant in three out of five individuals, all without congenital nephro-urological anomalies. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the presence of a not previously described heterozygous genetic variant of the HNF1B gene. This work initiates the search for this type of mutations in our region which allows us to ap proach the knowledge of causality, determination of extrarenal involvement, and genetic counseling.

30735108|t|Increased expression of CD40/TRAF1 and activation of nuclear factor-kappakappaB-dependent proinflammatory gene expression in collagen-induced arthritis.
30735108|a|OBJECTIVE: Genetic studies have implicated both CD40 and tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-1 (TRAF1) with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). CD40 signalling is known to be associated with TRAF1 expression, directly or indirectly; however, the detailed mechanisms of these interactions are not clear in RA, and in particular in fibroblast-like synoviocytes. This study aims to investigate this pathway and the role of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in a mouse model of RA. METHOD: We utilized the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model in DBA/1 mice. CD40, TRAF1, and NF-kappaB p65 were quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry in serum and tissue, respectively. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was applied to measure NF-kappaB-related gene expression, including cytokines [tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6)] and adhesion molecules [intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)]. RESULTS: The severity of arthritis by clinical and histological assessments peaked on day 35 and decreased thereafter. Serum levels of CD40, TRAF1, and NF-kappaB p65 paralleled this time-course. The tissue expression of the CD40, TRAF1, total NF-kappaB p65, and phospho-NF-kappaB p65 proteins, as well as NF-kappaB-related gene expression, including cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-6) and adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1), were markedly upregulated within 25-50 days after CIA. CONCLUSION: Our data identify a cellular/molecular mechanism of the CD40/TRAF1 signalling pathway involved in CIA: increased expression of CD40 and its adaptor TRAF1 proteins and activation of the NF-kappaB-dependent proinflammatory pathway. These correlations implicate possible mechanistic pathways in this model that may also operate in human RA and thus provide rationales for new therapeutic modalities.

30736902|t|Reactivity of microglia and astrocytes after an excitotoxic injury induced by kainic acid in the rat spinal cord.
30736902|a|After injury of the nervous system glial cells react according to the stimuli by modifying their morphology and function. Glia activation was reported in different kainic acid (KA)-induced neurodegeneration models. Here, we describe glial morphometric changes occurring in an excitotoxic KA-induced cervical spinal cord injury model. Concomitant degenerative and apoptotic processes are also reported. Male rats injected at the spinal cord C5 segment either with KA or saline were euthanized at post-injection (PI) days 1, 2, 3 or 7. Anti-IBA-1 and anti-GFAP antibodies were used to identify microglia and activated astrocytes, respectively, and to morphometrically characterized them. Fluoro-Jade B staining and TUNEL reaction were used to determine neuronal and glial degeneration and apoptosis. KA-injected group showed a significant increase in microglia number at the ipsilateral side by PI day 3. Different microglia reactive phenotypes were observed. Reactive microglia was still present by PI day 7. Astrocytes in KA-injected group showed a biphasic increase in number at PI days 1 and 3. Degenerative and apoptotic events were only observed in KA-injected animals, increasing mainly by PI day 1. Understanding the compromise of glia in different neurodegenerative processes may help to define possible common or specific therapeutic approaches directed towards neurorestorative strategies.

30736903|t|The effect of docosahexaenoic acid on apelin distribution of nervous system in the experimental mouse model of Parkinson's disease.
30736903|a|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder of the human central and peripheral nervous systems. n-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22: 6n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as well as apelin have anti-inflammatory effects in various cells. At the same time, apelin has anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects. The study was conducted to determine the effect of DHA on the distribution of apelin and apelin receptor (APJ) in the central nervous system in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model. DHA treatment decreased the return time and total down time in the Parkinson group which were measured by pole test. Besides, the ambulatory activity, distance and total locomotor activity were increased by DHA in the PD model of animals. The time mice remained on the rotating rod mile was also significantly increased by DHA treatment in MPTP injected animals. The apelin expression in the pons of mice in the Parkinson, DHA and Parkinson + DHA groups were lower compared to the Control group. When apelin and apelin receptor expressions in cerebrum were examined, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. When apelin receptor expression in cerebellum was examined, the difference between the Control and Parkinson + DHA, Parkinson and Parkinson + DHA, DHA and Parkinson + DHA groups were statistically significant. Apelin receptor expressions in pons of the Parkinson, DHA and Parkinson + DHA groups were lower compared to the Control group. Apelin protein levels of cerebellum and pons were found to be decreased in DHA group compare with Control group. In conclusion; DHA has been implicated in the expression of the apelin receptor and has reduced the expression of APJ receptor.

30736907|t|Non-integrin laminin receptors in epithelia.
30736907|a|The interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) play a major role in normal and pathological conditions. The ECM can modulate several biological functions including cell proliferation, adhesion, differentiation and survival through its interactions with cell receptors. Laminins are one of the most important glycoproteins present in basement membranes, a type of ECM. The pattern of expression of its different isoforms depends on the spatiotemporal organization of each tissue. While integrins are the most studied laminin receptors, other non-integrin laminin receptors are also involved. This review focuses on two particular non-integrin laminin receptors in the epithelial context: dystroglycan and 37/67 laminin receptor (37/67LR). Dystroglycan is a two-subunit protein discovered in the muscle as part of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex. This protein can also be found in many epithelia where its roles are variable. The 37/67LR is a still incompletely understood laminin receptor that is important to regulate intestinal epithelial cell function and could be involved in various pathological conditions.

30743847|t|Intake of lead (Pb) from tap water of homes with leaded and low lead plumbing systems.
30743847|a|Methods of quantifying consumer exposure to lead in drinking water are increasingly of interest worldwide, especially those that account for consumer drinking habits and the semi-random nature of water lead release from plumbing systems. A duplicate intake protocol was developed in which individuals took a sub-sample from each measured drink they consumed in the home over three days in both winter and summer. The protocol was applied in two different water company regional areas (WC1 and WC2), selected to represent high risk situations in England, with the presence or absence of lead service pipes or phosphate corrosion control. Consumer exposure to lead was highest in properties with lead service pipes, served by water without P dosing. The protocol indicated that a small number of individuals in the study, all from homes with lead service pipes, consumed lead at levels that exceeded current guidance from the European Food Standards Agency. Children's potential blood lead levels (BLLs) were estimated using the Internal Exposure Uptake Biokinetic model (IEUBK). The IEUBK model predicted that up to 46% of children aged 0-7 years old may have elevated BLLs (&gt;5 mug/dL) when consuming the worst case drinking water quality (&gt;99%ile). Estimating blood lead levels using the IEUBK model for more typical lead concentrations in drinking water identified in this study (between 0.1 and 7.1 mug/L), predicts that elevated BLLs may affect a small proportion of children between 0 and 7 years old.

30743858|t|Piggery wastewater treatment by Acinetobacter sp. TX5 immobilized with spent mushroom substrate in a fixed-bed reactor.
30743858|a|Acinetobacter sp. TX5 immobilized with spent Hypsizygus marmoreus substrate (SHMS) was used to treat the raw piggery wastewater (RPW). In batch experiments, NH4+-N in the diluted RPW decreased from initial 34.95 mg/L to 3.83 mg/L at 8 h with the removal efficiency (RE) being 89%, and the beads immobilized with SHMS were comparable to those immobilized with activated carbon. In continuous experiments, the RE ranged from 74% to 95% for NH4+-N, from 73% to 93% for TN and from 54% to 82% for COD when the RPW was treated in a fixed-bed reactor packed with SHMS-immobilized TX5. The isotope analysis and enzyme purification indicated simultaneous nitrification and denitrification existing in TX5. This is the first time that spent mushroom substrates have been used to immobilize Acinetobacter species to treat the real RPW and a denitrifying nitrite reductase (dNiR) has been purified to make the nitrogen removal pathway in this species clearer.

30743866|t|Using urease and nitrification inhibitors to decrease ammonia and nitrous oxide emissions and improve productivity in a subtropical pasture.
30743866|a|Urease and nitrification inhibitors are designed to mitigate ammonia (NH3) volatilization and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, but uncertainties on the agronomic and economic benefits of these inhibitors prevent their widespread adoption in pasture systems, particularly in subtropical regions where no such information is available. Here we report a field experiment that was conducted in a subtropical pasture in Queensland, Australia to examine whether the use of the urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT, applied as Green UreaNV ) and the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP, applied as Urea with ENTEC ) is environmentally, agronomically and economically viable. We found that Green UreaNV  and Urea with ENTEC  decreased NH3 volatilization and N2O emission by 44 and 15%, respectively, compared to granular urea. Pasture biomass and nitrogen (N) uptake were increased by 22-36% and 23-32%, respectively, with application of the inhibitors compared to granular urea. A simple economic assessment indicates that the fertilizer cost for pasture production was 5.4, 4.4 and 6.0 Australian cents per kg dry matter for urea, Green UreaNV  and Urea with ENTEC , respectively, during the experimental period. The mitigation of N loss using the inhibitors can reduce the environmental cost associated with pasture production. These results suggest that the use of these inhibitors can provide environmental, agronomic and economic benefits to a subtropical pasture.

30743879|t|Root and detritus of transgenic Bt crop did not change nematode abundance and community composition but enhanced trophic connections.
30743879|a|Transgenic Bacillus thuringensis (Bt) crops are widely deployed to control lepidopterous pests with minimal impact on non-target soil invertebrates. However, most of the results were obtained from field works, the great environmental variation may conceal the small spatial-temporal scaled changes in microhabitats, such as those created near the roots (rhizosphere) or around decomposing residues (detritusphere), which are expected to impact free-living soil organisms more than the bulk soils. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of root and straw residues of transgenic crops on soil, by comparing nematode communities in the rhizosphere (soil microsites only affected by living root), the detritusphere (soil microsites affected by crop aboveground residues) and the rhizosphere-detritusphere interface (soil microsites intensively co-affected by root and residues) of Bt rice and its non-Bt near isoline. Bt rice did not affect nematode abundance and community composition, however, it enhanced the network connections within nematode communities, in both the rhizosphere and detritusphere, indicating the frequency of co-occurring species increased due to the moderate stress of crystal (Cry) as a labile resource of protein or as a moderate pressure of toxic compounds. Furthermore, 60-80% of the correlation between Cry protein (Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac) and nematode genera were positive in the rhizosphere and detritusphere of Bt rice, suggesting that higher Cry protein concentration was associated with the intensive co-occurrence among nematode populations. This finding offers new insights into how the biotic interactions of non-target soil community response to both live and dead parts of transgenic crop, highlighting the moderate stress of Cry protein might affect the community structure and consequent functioning of soil ecosystem based on the elaborately developed knowledge of biotic interactions via ecological network analysis.

30743888|t|Nanoparticles in the lungs of old mice: Pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress without procoagulant effects.
30743888|a|Pulmonary exposure to nanoparticles (NPs) has been shown to induce pulmonary as well as cardiovascular toxicity. These effects might be enhanced in elderly subjects as a result of a compromised immunity and/or declined organ functions. To study the adverse in vivo effects of NPs in a model for the elderly, we exposed 18-month-old C75Bl/6 mice to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) or ZnO NPs by intratracheal instillation once a week during 5 consecutive weeks. Pulmonary and hemostatic toxicity was determined 24 h (T1) and 8 weeks (T2) after the last administration. Both NP types significantly increased the pulmonary macrophages at both time points. The MWCNTs and ZnO NPs also induced a pulmonary influx of neutrophils, which was even larger at T2 compared to T1. All NPs induced only a modest increase of pulmonary IL-1beta, IL-6 and KC levels. Both types of NPs also increased blood neutrophils. Red blood cells were not significantly affected. Both NPs significantly increased coagulation factor VIII levels at both time points. Histological analysis revealed the presence of MWCNTs in the alveolar macrophages up to 8 weeks after the last administration and the ZnO NPs induced a pronounced alveolar inflammation. In these 18-month-old mice, NPs caused pulmonary inflammation (without evidence of oxidative stress) accompanied by large increases in coagulation factor VIII up to 8 weeks after the last NP exposure. The persistence of the MWCNTs in the lungs resulted in translocation from the lungs to the left heart and the ZnO NPs induced a fibrosis-like pathology.

30743956|t|Natural and assisted dissipation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in a long-term co-contaminated soil with creosote and potentially toxic elements.
30743956|a|An enhanced bioremediation strategy was applied to an industrial soil co-contaminated with Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs). Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) and a natural mixture of two rhamnolipids (RL) were added to increase PAHs bioavailability, and combined with a microbial consortium (MC) to biodegrade soil PAHs. Bioavailability of only six PAHs (3-, 4-ring PAHs) increased when using HPBCD, with a maximum increase about 2.8-fold higher. The highest dose of HPBCD (5%) enhanced PAH degradation, with the best results for 4-ring PAHs with treatments of HPBCD + MC (up to 48% degradation for pyrene and 43% for fluoranthene), whereas dissipation for 5-ring PAHs was very low and for 6-ring was negligible. The use of RL increased the bioavailability of 13 of the 16 PAHs studied, reaching up to 60-fold higher values for phenanthrene or 18-fold higher for acenaphtene. RL addition did not show degradation improvement in any situation, and even inhibited the scarce degradation observed in the control treatment. The high increase in availability of both PAHs and mainly PTEs when using RL as amendment could make them toxic for microorganisms. In fact, Microtox Acute Toxicity test using Aliivibrio fischeri and the absence of colony forming units (CFUs) of indigenous bacteria demonstrated the extremely high levels of toxicity in RL treated soil.

30744816|t|Specific regions of the SulA protein recognized and degraded by the ATP-dependent ClpYQ (HslUV) protease in Escherichia coli.
30744816|a|In Escherichia coli, ClpYQ (HslUV) is a two-component ATP-dependent protease, in which ClpQ is the peptidase subunit and ClpY is the ATPase and unfoldase. ClpY functions to recognize protein substrates, and denature and translocate the unfolded polypeptides into the proteolytic site of ClpQ for degradation. However, it is not clear how the natural substrates are recognized by the ClpYQ protease and the mechanism by which the substrates are selected, unfolded and translocated by ClpY into the interior site of ClpQ hexamers. Both Lon and ClpYQ proteases can degrade SulA, a cell division inhibitor, in bacterial cells. In this study, using yeast two-hybrid and in vivo degradation analyses, we first demonstrated that the C-terminal internal hydrophobic region (139th~149th aa) of SulA is necessary for binding and degradation by ClpYQ. A conserved region, GFIMRP, between 142th and 147th residues of SulA, were identified among various Gram-negative bacteria. By using MBP-SulA(F143Y) (phenylalanine substituted with tyrosine) as a substrate, our results showed that this conserved residue of SulA is necessary for recognition and degradation by ClpYQ. Supporting these data, MBP-SulA(F143Y), MBP-SulA(F143N) (phenylalanine substituted with asparagine) led to a longer half-life with ClpYQ protease in vivo. In contrast, MBP-SulA(F143D) and MBP-SulA(F143S) both have shorter half-lives. Therefore, in the E. coli ClpYQ protease complex, ClpY recognizes the C-terminal region of SulA, and F143 of SulA plays an important role for the recognition and degradation by ClpYQ protease.

30744819|t|Differential involvement of glycans in the binding of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Corynebacterium spp. to human sweat.
30744819|a|Sweat is a secretory fluid that can be a source of unpleasant body odour due to interaction of resident bacteria with sweat components. Identification of glycoproteins in sweat suggests that protein-conjugated glycans may act as binding epitopes for bacteria, as found in other secretory fluids such as human milk, tears and saliva which help to protect epithelial surfaces from infection. We conducted proteomic and glycomic analysis of sweat to reveal an abundance of glycoproteins, predominantly carrying bi-antennary sialylated N-glycans with or without fucose. A fluorescent plate assay was used to determine whether glycans on sweat proteins provide binding epitopes for odour-producing skin commensals Staphylococcus epidermidis and Corynebacterium. Sialic acid and fucose were found to be important binding epitopes for S. epidermidis 3-22-BD-6, a strain recently isolated from human sweat, whereas fucose (but not sialic acid) contributed to the binding of Type strain S. epidermidis ATCC 12228. In contrast, our results indicate that sweat N-glycans do not provide binding epitopes for Corynebacterium. Synthetic sugar mimics of Lewis blood group antigens were investigated as potential inhibitors of the binding of S. epidermidis 3-22-BD-6 to sweat. Pre-incubation of the bacterium with LeB, LeX, LeY and sLeX (pentaose) resulted in a significant reduction in sweat protein adhesion indicating that terminal fucose is a key binding epitope, particularly when linked to a Type 2 chain (Galbeta1-4GlcNAc) configuration (LeY). Our results form an impetus for future studies seeking to elucidate the role of glycans in sweat associated malodour, with possible implications for cosmetic and medical fields.

30744820|t|Sestrin-like protein from Dictyostelium discoideum is involved in autophagy under starvation stress.
30744820|a|Sestrins are highly conserved; stress inducible proteins that help maintain metabolic homeostasis and protect cells under stress conditions. They are up-regulated during stress and influence AMPK and mTOR pathways. Our objective was to find the role of Sestrin protein from Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd), a lower eukaryote where starvation stress initiates multicellular development. The single DdSesn-like gene was expressed and its endogenous functions were characterized. Both, the knockout and constitutively expressing strains were made and their involvement in starvation-induced autophagy was analyzed. Autophagic fluxes and ROS levels were also monitored. Additionally, overexpression of DdSesn decreased cell growth and showed a longer lag phase. Upon starvation both DdSesn and ROS levels increased. SesnOE showed reduced ROS levels while sesn- showed increased ROS levels when compared to the wild type. Therefore, we suggest that increased sesn expression may be beneficial in reducing ROS levels during starvation. Deletion of sesn showed reduced autophagic flux and increased p4EBP1 levels. We show that DdSesn promotes autophagy in D. discoideum upon starvation.

30744888|t|Characterization of propiconazole field-resistant isolates of Ustilaginoidea virens.
30744888|a|The plant-pathogenic fungus Ustilaginoidea virens (Cooke) Takah causes rice false smut (RFS), which is responsible for significant quantitative and qualitative losses in rice industry. Propiconazole is a triazole fungicide which belongs to Demethylation inhibitors (DMIs). It is used to control RFS in China. We previously screened 158 isolates of U. virens collected in the fields in 2015 in Jiangsu province of China, and found two of them were highly resistant to propiconazole (named 82 and 88, respectively). In this study, we have analyzed the physiological and biochemical characters of six field-sensitive isolates and the two field-resistant isolates, including mycelial growth and cell wall integrity. We found there was cross-resistance between different DMIs fungicides, but was no cross-resistance between DMIs and QoIs fungicides. We also analyzed the fitness, and found the pathogenicity in 88 was stronger than the field-sensitive isolates, but was completely lost in 82. Sequence analyses of CYP51 and the 1000-bp upstream of CYP51 coding region showed no mutation in 82 compared to the field-sensitive strains, but two more bases CC were identified at 154-bp upstream of the coding region in the field-resistant isolate 88. Moreover, the expression of CYP51 gene in all tested isolates was significantly induced by propiconazole. However, the up-regulation expression level in both 82 and 88 was much higher than that in the field-sensitive isolates. We also found propiconazole could inhibit the ergosterol biosynthesis in the field-sensitive isolates, but stimulated it in both field-resistant isolates 82 and 88. Given the high level of U. virens developing propiconazole resistance and the good fitness of the field-resistant isolate 88, the resistance of U. virens to DMIs must be monitored and managed in rice fields.

30744889|t|Effects of validamycin in controlling Fusarium head blight caused by Fusarium graminearum: Inhibition of DON biosynthesis and induction of host resistance.
30744889|a|Validamycin, known to interfere with fungal energy metabolism by inhibiting trehalase, has been extensively used to control plant diseases caused by Rhizoctonia spp. However, the effect of validamycin on controlling Fusarium graminearum has not been previously reported. In this study, when applied to F. graminearum in vitro, validamycin inhibited the synthesis of deoxynivalenol (DON), which is a mycotoxin and virulence factor, by decreasing trehalase activity and the production of glucose and pyruvate, which are precursors of DON biosynthesis. Because FgNTH encodes the main trehalase in F. graminearum, these effects were nullified in the FgNTH deletion mutant DeltaFgNTH but restored in the complemented strain DeltaFgNTHC. In addition, validamycin also increased the expression of pathogenesis-related genes (PRs) PR1, PR2, and PR5 in wheat, inducing resistance responses of wheat against F. graminearum. Therefore, validamycin exhibits dual efficacies on controlling Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by F. graminearum: inhibition of DON biosynthesis and induction of host resistance. In addition, field trials further confirmed that validamycin increased FHB control and reduced DON contamination in grain. Control of FHB and DON contamination by validamycin increased when the antibiotic was applied with the triazole fungicide metconazole. Overall, this study is a successful case from foundational research to applied research, providing useful information for wheat protection programs against toxigenic fungi responsible for FHB and the consequent mycotoxin accumulation in grains.

30744893|t|Silencing of triazophos-induced Hexokinase-1-like reduces fecundity in Nilaparvata lugens (Stal) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae).
30744893|a|Hexokinase is a rate-limiting enzyme that plays pivotal roles in glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism via glucose (Glc) phosphorylation and Glc signaling mediation. Previous investigations have revealed the modulatory role of Hexokinase (Hex) genes involved in proper glucose regulation during insect diapause and embryo development, whereas whether it functions in insect fecundity remains largely unknown. We aimed to explore the relationship between Triazophos (TZP)-induced Hex-1 and fecundity of female Nilaparvata lugens. In this study, Hex-1 expression were characterized at different developmental stages and in various tissues of N. lugens, with the highest expression registered in brain tissues and 5th instar nymph. The present findings indicated that TZP + dsHex-1 silencing significantly reduced protein synthesis, including the fat body and ovarian protein content of female adults. Meanwhile, the glycometabolism with respect to the soluble sugar, trehalose and glucose content in female adults were strikingly influenced as a result of Hex-1 knockdown. The relative transcript level of Hex-1, vitellogenin (NlVg) and vitellogenin receptor (NlVgR) considerably decreased in TZP + dsHex-1 treated females compared to TZP and TZP + dsGFP-treated groups. More importantly, TZP + dsHex-1 silencing led to reduced number of eggs laid and vitellogenin (Vg) accumulation as well as retarded ovary development compared with TZP-treated and TZP + dsGFP-treated groups. Taken together, it is proposed that Hex-1 implicates in N. lugens fecundity by exerting profound effects on glycometabolism, protein sythesis and NlVg expression.

30744895|t|A beta2-tubulin dsRNA derived from Fusarium asiaticum confers plant resistance to multiple phytopathogens and reduces fungicide resistance.
30744895|a|Crops are attacked by a large number of pathogens which are responsible for an approximately 30% loss in global crop production at pre- and post-harvest levels. In light of the continuing emergence of fungicide resistance, the needs for new agricultural drugs turn out to be much more critical. Here we demonstrated a Fabeta2Tub-3 dsRNA derived from Fusarium asiaticum had broad-spectrum antifungal activity against Fusarium spp., Botrytis cinerea, Magnaporthe oryzae and Colletotrichum truncatum, with an additional function of reducing the dosage of carbendazim (MBC) fungicide. RNAi molecules derived from different regions of beta2-tubulin gene had different effects on mycelial growth, asexual reproduction and virulence. Fabeta2Tub-3 (one of beta2-tubulin segments) exhibited a strong silencing efficacy both on beta1-tubulin and beta2-tubulin genes in F. asiaticum. Fabeta2Tub-3 sequence was found to be highly conserved among Fusarium spp., Botrytis cinerea, Magnaporthe oryzae and Colletotrichum truncatum. The Fabeta2Tub-3 dsRNA demonstrated a broad-spectrum antifungal activity against these fungi in vitro and on living plant. More importantly, Fabeta2Tub-3 dsRNA increased the fungal sensitivity to MBC, while MBC increased the duration of Fabeta2Tub-3 dsRNA. Our findings suggest a new anti-fungal agent (Fabeta2Tub-3 dsRNA) for plant protection against diverse pathogens and for fungicide reduction.

30744896|t|LC50 of lambda-cyhalothrin stimulates reproduction on the moth Mythimna separata (Walker).
30744896|a|Lambda-cyhalothrin has long been recommended as an effective insecticide to control the oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata (Walker), a notorious migratory pest of agricultural plants. Previous researches have suggested that survival, development, and reproduction of insects are influenced by sublethal concentrations of insecticides. However, the effects of sublethal concentrations of lambda-cyhalothrin on M. separata are less known. In this study, we determined the toxicity and effects of LC20 and LC50 concentration of lambda-cyhalothrin on development and reproduction of M. separata. Results indicate that LC20 of lambda-cyhalothrin tends to decrease the life traits of M. separate, with a shortening larvae period of offspring and oviposition period, whereas LC50 of lambda-cyhalothrin stimulates daily maximal fecundity and forwards the oviposition peak, suggesting a stimulation of reproduction by LC50 of lambda-cyhalothrin. The M. separata population was increased by an LC50 concentration of lambda-cyhalothrin, resulting in a net reproductive rate (R0) and intrinsic rate of increase (rm) significantly higher than that of the control. Transcripts of vitellogenin (MsVg) and vitellogenin receptor (MsVgR) genes were suppressed at day 1 after emergence of moth which developed from the larvae exposed to LC20 and LC50 of lambda-cyhalothrin, but were significant induced when the moth begin to lay eggs (day 4), with a more remarkable induction by LC50 of lambda-cyhalothrin than those of LC20 of lambda-cyhalothrin. Our results indicate that the observed stimulation of reproduction is therefore the results of up-regulation of MsVg and MsVgR by LC50 of lambda-cyhalothrin.

30744898|t|Jaburetox, a natural insecticide derived from Jack Bean Urease, activates voltage-gated sodium channels to modulate insect behavior.
30744898|a|Jaburetox (Jbtx) is an insecticidal peptide derived from Canavalia ensiformis urease, whose mechanism of action is not completely elucidated. We employed behavioral, electromyographical and electrophysiological protocols to identify the cellular and molecular targets involved in the Jbtx entomotoxicity in cockroaches and locusts. In Nauphoeta cinerea, Jbtx (32 mug/g) altered the locomotory behaviour inducing a significative decrease in the distance travelled followed by a significant increase in stopped time (52 +- 85 cm and 2573 +- 89 s, p &lt; .05, n = 40). Jbtx (8 to 32 mug/g body weight, respectively) also increased the leg and antennae grooming activities (p &lt; .05, n = 40, respectively). Jbtx (8 to 16 mug/g) induced a maximum neuromuscular blockade of 80.72% (n = 6, p &lt; .05) and was cardiotoxic, decreasing the cockroach heart rate. The electrophysiological profiles of both muscle and nerve of L. migratoria showed that Jbtx (2.5 x 10-7 and 2.5 x 10-3 mug/ body weight) induced a significant increase in the amplitude of nerve action potentials (n = 5, p &lt; .05). Voltage clamp analysis of Jbtx (200 nM) applied in Xenopus laevis oocytes heterologously expressed with Nav 1.1 channels showed a significant increase in the sodium currents. In conclusion, this work revealed that the entomotoxic activity of Jbtx involves complex behavioral alterations that begins with an initial activation of voltage-gated sodium channels.

30744899|t|Pymetrozine activates TRPV channels of brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.
30744899|a|The commercial insecticide pymetrozine has been extensively used for brown planthopper control in East Asia. The transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channel, which consists of two proteins, Nanchung (Nan) and Inactive (Iav), has recently been shown to be the molecular target of pymetrozine in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum). In this study, we characterized the Nan and Iav TRPV channel subunits of N. lugens and measured the action of pymetrozine on them. NlNan and NlIav are structurally similar to homologs from other insects. The expression pattern analysis of various body parts showed that NlNan and NlIav were both more abundantly expressed in antennae. When NlNan and NlIav were co-expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, they formed channels with high sensitivity to pymetrozine (EC50 = 5.5 x 10-8 M). Behavioral observation revealed that the gravitaxis defect in the fruit fly nan36a mutant was rescued by ectopically expressed NlNan and the rescued behavior could be abolished by pymetrozine. Our results confirm that NlNan and NlIav co-expressed complexes can be activated by pymetrozine both in vitro and in vivo and provide useful information for future resistance mechanism studies.

30759552|t|The effects of a therapeutic formalin bath on selected immunological and oxidative stress parameters in common carp (Cyprinus carpio).
30759552|a|Formalin is commonly used as a component of antiparasitic baths in fisheries. In this study the impact of this bath on the immune profile and oxidative stress parameters was evaluated. A formalin bath was prepared in the concentration of 185.3 mg L-1 (0.17 mL L-1) at a temperature of 20  C. A total of 96 common carp Cyprinus carpio (Linnaeus, 1758) individuals were immersed in this bath for 60 min. The effects were monitored immediately, and then after 24, 48 h and 10 days following the treatment. The study revealed the most effects 10 days after the treatment, when we observed the decrease of lysozyme in skin mucus, the decrease of anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor beta in gill tissue and increase of interleukin 10 in cranial kidney tissue. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1b showed an increase in gill tissue immediately after the bath and the increase in glutathione peroxidase in gill tissue was also observed 24 h and 10 days after bath treatment. The other investigated parameters did not show any significant changes. In conclusion, even though the formalin bath elevated some parameters as mentioned above, formalin used in the bath is probably safe as an antiparasitic treatment of fish.

30759554|t|Enantioselective thyroid disruption in zebrafish embryo-larvae via exposure to environmental concentrations of the chloroacetamide herbicide acetochlor.
30759554|a|Acetochlor (ACT) is a chiral chloroacetamide pesticide that has been heavily used around the world, resulting in its residues being frequently found in surface waters. It has been reported that ACT is an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) with strong thyroid hormone-disrupting activity in aquatic organisms. However, the enantioselectivity underlying thyroid disruption has yet to be understood. In this study, using a zebrafish embryo-larvae model, the enantioselective thyroid disruption of ACT was investigated at a series of environmentally relevant concentrations (1, 2, 10 and 50 mug/L). Our results showed that both racemic ACT and its enantiomers significantly increased the malformation rates of embryos at 72 h postfertilization (hpf). Decreased thyroxine (T4) contents and increased triiodothyronine (T3) contents were found in larvae at 120 hpf, with (+)-S-ACT exhibiting a greater effect than (-)-R-enantiomer. Similarly, (+)-S-ACT also showed a stronger effect on the mRNA expressions of thyroid hormone receptors (TRalpha and TRbeta), deiodinase2 (Dio2) and thyroid-stimulating hormone-beta (TSHbeta) genes. The observed enantioselectivity in TR expressions was consistent with that of in silico binding analysis, which suggested that (+)-S-enantiomer binds more potently to the TRs than (-)-R-enantiomer. In general, ACT enantiomers showed different influences on the secretion of THs, expression of TH-related key genes and binding affinity to TRs. Considering the different toxicity of different enantiomers, our study highlights the importance of enantioselectivity in understanding of thyroid disruption effects of chiral pesticides.

30759589|t|High-resolution inventory of mercury emissions from biomass burning in tropical continents during 2001-2017.
30759589|a|Mercury emissions from biomass burning contribute significantly to the atmospheric mercury budget and the interannual variation of mercury concentrations in the troposphere. This study developed a high-resolution (0.1  x 0.1 ) monthly inventory of mercury emissions from biomass burning across five land types in the tropical continents (Central and South America, Africa, and South and Southeast Asia) during 2001-2017. The inventory estimates of mercury emissions from biomass burning are based on the newly released MCD64A1 Version 6 Burned Area data product, satellite and observational data of biomass density, and spatial and temporal variable combustion factors. Results from the inventory demonstrated that during 2001-2017, the average annual mercury emissions from biomass burning in tropical continents was 497 Mg and ranged from 289 Mg to 681 Mg. Forest fires were the largest contributor, accounting for 61% (300 Mg) of the total mercury emissions from biomass burning, followed by fires in woody savanna/shrubland (30%, 151 Mg), savanna/grassland (7%, 35 Mg), peatland (1%, 6 Mg), and cropland (1%, 5 Mg). However, these proportions varied between the continents; in the Americas and Asia, the largest biomass burning emissions came from forest fires, and in Africa the largest emissions were from fires woody savanna/shrubland. Between the three continents, Africa released 41% of the mercury emissions from biomass burning (202 Mg year-1), Asia released 31% (154 Mg year-1), and the Americas released 28% (141 Mg year-1). The total mercury emissions from biomass burning in these tropical continents exhibited strong interannual variations from 2001 to 2017, with peak emissions in March and August to September, and forest fires were the primary land type controlling the interannual variations.

30759593|t|Early development of apoplastic barriers and molecular mechanisms in juvenile maize roots in response to La2O3 nanoparticles.
30759593|a|The increasing occurrence of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) in soils may decrease water uptake in crops, followed by lower crop yield and quality. As one of the most common rare earth oxide NPs, lanthanum oxide (La2O3) NPs may inhibit the relative expressions of aquaporin genes, thus reduce water uptake. In the present study, maize plants were exposed to different La2O3 NPs concentrations (0, 5, 50 mg L-1) for 72 h and 144 h right after the first leaf extended completely. Our results revealed that water uptake was reduced by La2O3 NPs through accelerating the development of apoplastic barriers in maize roots. The level of abscisic acid, determined by using ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, was increased upon La2O3 NPs exposure. Furthermore, ZmPAL, ZmCCR2 and ZmCAD6, the core genes specific for biosynthesis of lignin, were up-regulated by 3-13 fold in roots exposed to 50 mg L-1 La2O3 NPs. However, ZmF5H was suppressed, indicating that lignin with S units could be excluded for the formed lignin in apoplastic barriers upon La2O3 NPs exposure. The level of essential component of apoplastic barriers - lignin was increased by 1.5-fold. The early development of apoplastic barriers was observed, and stomatal conductance and transpiration rate of La2O3 NPs-treated plants were significantly decreased by 63%-83% and 42%-86%, respectively, as compared to the control. The lignin enriched apoplastic barriers in juvenile maize thus led to the reduction of water uptake, subsequently causing significant growth inhibition. This is the first study to show early development of root apoplastic barriers upon La2O3 NPs exposure. This study will help us better understand the function of apoplastic barriers in roots in response to NPs, further providing fundamental knowledge to develop safer and more efficient agricultural nanotechnology.

30759596|t|Low concentrations of copper oxide nanoparticles alter microbial community structure and function of sediment biofilms.
30759596|a|In this study, we investigated the effects of copper oxide (CuO) NPs on freshwater sediment biofilms in terms of the functional properties and microbial community structure. Biofilms were incubated in microcosms and CuO NPs (1 mg/L uncoated and humic-acid-coated) were exposed with Cu2+ (Cu(NO3)2) as the positive control. As determined from DO (dissolved oxygen) microelectrodes measurements, a high-DO region emerged inside the biofilms after 5-day exposure to CuO NPs compared with those before NP additions, which suggested CuO NPs inhibit the oxygen respiration activity. These results were consistent with the decreased heterotrophic respiration. CuO NPs significantly altered the bacterial community composition and decreased the abundances of Anaerolineaceae, Acidobacteria, Aminicenantes, and Anaerolinea. Functional analysis from PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States)-predicted metagenomes indicated that bacterial genera depleted by CuO NP treatments were related to carbohydrate and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites. These functional profiles combined with the decreased activities of extracellular enzymes, beta-glucosidase (GLU) and l-leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), suggested that the introduction of CuO NPs exhibit negative effects on the biogeochemical processes and the cycling of carbon and nitrogen in biofilm systems. Whereas these toxic effects of CuO NPs could be mitigated when the aquatic environment is enriched with natural organic matters such as humic acid.

30759598|t|Microbial nitrate removal efficiency in groundwater polluted from agricultural activities with hybrid cork treatment wetlands.
30759598|a|Agricultural practices have raised the level of nutrients reaching aquifers. In Europe, nitrate pollution is considered as one of the main threats for the quality of groundwater in agricultural areas. Treatment wetlands (TWs), also known as Constructed Wetlands, are used for groundwater treatment in areas with an important concentration of nitrogen compounds; total nitrogen removal depends on the type and operation scheme. Cork by-product from the industry has shown clear adsorbent properties to remove organic pollutants. The work is focused on the characterization of microbial communities involved in the nitrate-nitrogen removal process in groundwater polluted from agricultural activities. The experimental design allowed the comparison of nitrate removal efficiency depending on the filter media material, cork by-product or gravel, used in two hybrid TWs (a vertical flow cell followed by a horizontal subsurface flow cell), installed in areas close to two irrigated agricultural plots at the Lleida plain area (Spain). Both physicochemical and microbial results were consistent and confirm the nitrate removal efficiency using cork as a filter media. A significant (p = 0.0025) higher removal in Bellvis TW using cork compared with the Vilanova de la Barca gravel system was observed, achieving a removal rate from 80 to 99% compared to the 5-46%, respectively. Regarding the community composition of the two different TWs, microorganisms were mainly related to the phylum Proteobacteria, and included members found to be key players in the nitrogen cycle, such as ammonia and nitrite oxidizers, as well as denitrifiers. Also, the group Bacteroidetes turns to be another abundant phylum from our bacterial dataset, whose members are suggested to be strongly involved in denitrification processes. Some groups showed to prevail depending on the type of media (cork or gravel); Firmicutes and Delta and Epsilonproteobacteria had a significant higher abundance in the TW with cork, while Acidobacteria and Planctomyces were prevalent in gravel. Therefore, cork could be an alternative material used by treatment wetlands to minimize the impact in the environment caused by nitrogen pollution in groundwater bodies.

30759600|t|Heavy metal pollution and potential health risks of commercially available Chinese herbal medicines.
30759600|a|A survey was conducted to investigate the pollution and health risks of copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), mercury (Hg) and zinc (Zn) in 60 Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) collected from a market in Kunming City, Yunnan Province, China. Furthermore, eight CHMs (Cyathulae radix, Drynariae rhizoma, Peucedani radix, Homalomenae rhizoma, Dryopteris setosa, Polygonati rhizoma, Lilii bulbus, and Linderae radix) containing high Cd concentrations were selected to further analyse their Cd chemical forms. Additionally, the dissolution rates of six heavy metals in decoction liquid were also analysed for four CHMs (Typhonii rhizoma, Linderae radix, Homalomenae rhizoma, and Cyathulae radix), and the health risks of heavy metals in CHMs were evaluated. The results showed that the Cd, Hg and Cu concentrations in the 60 CHMs exceeded the limiting values of the "Green Trade Standards of Importing &amp; Exporting Medicinal Plants &amp; Preparations" (WM2-2001), with exceedance ratios of 38.8%, 8.3% and 1.7%, respectively. The majority of Cd was integrated with pectates and protein in CHMs, and the other five Cd chemical forms followed the order of water-soluble &gt; insoluble heavy metal phosphates &gt; oxalate &gt; residual &gt; inorganic form, indicating that Cd had relatively low bioactivity and toxicity. The average dissolution rates of Zn, Cu, Cd, Hg, As and Pb in the four CHMs were 47.4%, 33.8%, 20.5%, 6.1%, 5.4% and 4.8%, respectively. The calculation results of hazard quotients (HQs) for Cd and Hg showed that the CHMs did not pose a threat to human health.

30759618|t|Can low concentrations of metal oxide and Ag loaded metal oxide nanoparticles pose a risk to stream plant litter microbial decomposers?
30759618|a|Nanoparticles (NPs) continue to be extensively produced by many industries, which ultimately leads to its release into the aquatic environment. It is crucial to estimate the impact of low concentrations of NPs which are environmentally relevant. Litter decomposition is a key ecological process in forested streams; microbes like fungi and bacteria are recognised to play a vital role in litter decomposition. In this study, zinc oxide (ZnO), titanium dioxide (TiO2), silver loaded ZnO (Ag/ZnO) and silver loaded TiO2 (Ag/TiO2) NPs were synthesized, and impacts of low concentrations (0, 2.5, 25, 50 muM) on leaf litter decomposition, fungal sporulation and bacterial growth were assessed. Fungal assemblages consisting of Articulospora tetracladia, Neonectria lugdunensis, Tricladium splendens and Varicosporium elodeae were used to study litter decomposition in microcosms exposed to NPs for 21 days. Two freshwater bacterial species belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae were used to assess growth after 12 h of exposure to NPs. Types and concentrations of NPs affected litter decomposition and sporulation but not growth of bacteria. Leaf mass loss was significantly different between all concentrations but not between 25 and 50 muM. Fungal sporulation was significantly different among all concentrations of NPs. Fungal sporulation decreased with increase in concentration of NPs whereas a particular trend was not observed with mass loss except for Ag/ZnO. A 50 muM of Ag/ZnO had the highest impact on litter decomposition while 50 muM of ZnO on sporulation. The impact of Ag loaded metal oxides were not strikingly different from those of bare metal oxides except for the more pronounced impact on the mass loss accomplished by Ag/ZnO than by ZnO. Overall our study highlights that very low concentrations of NPs in freshwaters can impact freshwater ecosystem functioning.

30759623|t|N2 fixation associated with the bryophyte layer is suppressed by low levels of nitrogen deposition in boreal forests.
30759623|a|Biological fixation of atmospheric nitrogen (N2) by bryophyte-associated cyanobacteria is an important source of plant-available N in the boreal biome. Information on the factors that drive biological N2 fixation (BNF) rates is needed in order to understand the N dynamics of forests under a changing climate. We assessed the potential of several cryptogam species (the feather mosses Hylocomium splendens and Pleurozium schreberi, a group of Dicranum bryophytes, two liverworts, and Cladina lichens) to serve as associates of cyanobacteria or other N2-fixing bacteria (diazotrophs) using acetylene reduction assay (ARA). We tested the hypotheses that the legacy of chronic atmospheric N deposition reduces BNF in the three bryophyte species, sampled from 12 coniferous forests located at latitudes 60-68  N in Finland. In addition, we tested the effect of moisture and temperature on BNF. All species studied showed a BNF signal in the north, with the highest rates in feather mosses. In moss samples taken along the north-south gradient with an increasing N bulk deposition from 0.8 to 4.4 kg ha-1 year-1, we found a clear decrease in BNF in both feather mosses and Dicranum group. BNF turned off at N deposition of 3-4 kg ha-1 year-1. Inorganic N (NH4-N + NO3-N) best predicted the BNF rate among regression models with different forms of N deposition as explanatory variables. However, in southern spruce stands, tree canopies modified the N in throughfall so that dissolved organic N (DON) leached from canopies compensated for inorganic N retained therein. Here, both DON and inorganic N negatively affected BNF in H. splendens. In laboratory experiments, BNF increased with increasing temperature and moisture. Our results suggest that even relatively low N deposition suppresses BNF in bryophyte-associated diazotrophs. Further, BNF could increase in northern low-deposition areas, especially if climate warming leads to moister conditions, as predicted.

30765055|t|Overexpression of CYP6ER1 associated with clothianidin resistance in Nilaparvata lugens (Stal).
30765055|a|The brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stal), is one of the most economically important rice pests in Asia and has become resistant to various kinds of insecticides, including neonicotinoid insecticides. In this study, an N. lugens clothianidin-resistant (CLR) strain and a susceptible (CLS) strain were established, and the potential resistance mechanisms of N. lugens to clothianidin were elucidated. The cross-resistance studies showed that the clothianidin-resistant strain exhibited cross-resistance to most neonicotinoid insecticides, especially nitenpyram (99.19-fold) and dinotefuran (77.68-fold), while there was no cross-resistance to chlorpyrifos (1.79-fold). The synergism assays and the activities of the detoxification enzymes were performed, and we found that a cytochrome P450 conferred the clothianidin resistance. Two P450 genes (CYP6ER1 and CYP6AY1) were found to be significantly overexpressed in the CLR strain compared with the CLS strain based on qRT-PCR. In addition, the knockdown of CYP6ER1 by RNA interference dramatically increased the toxicity of clothianidin against N. lugens. These data demonstrated that the overexpression of CYP6ER1 could contribute to clothianidin resistance in N. lugens. Our findings will help to improve the design of effective resistance management strategies to control brown planthoppers.

30765056|t|Transcriptional response of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters to insecticides in the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera.
30765056|a|When any living organism is frequently exposed to any drugs or toxic substances, they evolve different detoxification mechanism to confront with toxicants during absorption and metabolism. Likewise, the insects have evolved detoxification mechanisms as they are frequently exposed to different toxic secondary plant metabolites and commercial insecticides. ABC transporter superfamily is one of the largest and ubiquitous group of proteins which play an important role in phase III of the detoxification process. However, knowledge about this gene family remains largely unknown. To help fill this gap, we have identified a total of 54 ABC transporters in the Helicoverpa armigera genome which are classified into eight subfamilies (A-H) by phylogenetic analysis. The temporal and spatial expression profiles of these 54 ABC transporters throughout H. armigera development stages and seven tissues and their responses to five different insecticides, were investigated using RNA-seq analysis. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of eight selected genes in different tissues and six genes responses to insecticides were confirmed by the quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Moreover, H. armigera become more sensitive to abamectin and indoxacarb when P-gp was inhibited. These results provide a foundation for further studies of ABCs in H. armigera.

30765057|t|Identification of a cytochrome P450 CYP6AB60 gene associated with tolerance to multi-plant allelochemicals from a polyphagous caterpillar tobacco cutworm (Spodoptera litura).
30765057|a|Generalist phytophagous insects adapt to adventurous chemical environment in a wide variety of host plants by extraordinary detoxifying metabolic abilities. However, how polyphagous insect cope with the diversity of plant defenses remains largely unknown and only a few counter-defense genes detoxifying a wide range of toxic secondary metabolites have been well characterized. Here, we identify a cytochrome P450 gene (CYP6AB60) from tobacco cutworm (Spodoptera litura) in response to three different plant's defense metabolites. After being exposed to artificial diet supplemented with coumarin (COU), xanthotoxin (XAN) or tomatine (TOM), activities of P450 and CYP6AB60 transcript levels in both midgut and fat body tissues were significantly increased. Developmental expression analysis revealed that CYP6AB60 was expressed highly during the larval stages, and tissue distribution analysis showed that CYP6AB60 was expressed extremely high in the midgut, which correspond to the physiological role of CYP6AB60 from S. litura larvae in response to plant allelochemicals. Furthermore, when larvae are injected with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific to CYP6AB60, levels of this transcript in the midgut and fatbody decrease and the negative effect of plant's defense metabolites on larval growth is magnified. These data demonstrate that the generalist insect S. litura might take advantage of an individual detoxificative gene CYP6AB60 to toxic secondary metabolites from different host plants. The CYP6AB60 can be a potential gene to carry out RNAi-mediated crop protection against the major polyphagous pest S. litura in the future.

30765058|t|Natural beta-carboline alkaloids regulate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and induce autophagy in insect Sf9 cells.
30765058|a|The beta-carboline alkaloids are a large group of naturally occurring and synthetic indole alkaloids with remarkable pharmacological properties. Furthermore, these alkaloids have also been reported to be effective agents for controlling many pests and plant pathogenic nematodes. However, studies on these potential insecticidal components are scarce. The previous finding that these bioactive compounds can induce programmed cell death in cancer cell lines provided a new insight for exploration of their toxicological mechanisms on insects. In the present study, the cytotoxicity of five natural harmala alkaloids was measured, and the autophagy-inducing effect was confirmed in the Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cultured cell line. The results demonstrated that these alkaloids inhibited the proliferation of Sf9 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and the unsaturated beta-carboline alkaloids, harmine and harmol, exhibited stronger autophagy induction activity based on monodansylcadaverineand LysoTracker Red staining. Many autophagy-related genes were increased after beta-carbolines treatment at the RNA level, and the protein expression of Sf-Atg8 was also confirmed to increase after treatment. In addition, the primary autophagic signaling pathway, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, was altered during the procedure. Furthermore, experiments with special inhibitors and activators were performed to confirm the effect of beta-carbolines on this pathway. The results suggested that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway primarily regulated harmine-induced autophagy in insect cells, and this finding may potentially benefit the application of these promising bioactivity components.

30765059|t|Benzothiazole inhibits the growth of Phytophthora capsici through inducing apoptosis and suppressing stress responses and metabolic detoxification.
30765059|a|Benzothiazole (BZO) is an antimicrobial secondary metabolite volatilized by many plants and microbes. However, the mechanism of BZO against phytopathogens is still unclear. Here, we found that BZO has antimicrobial activity against the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora capsici. Transcriptome and proteome analyses demonstrated that BZO significantly suppressed the expression of genes and proteins involved in morphology, abiotic stress defense and detoxification, but induced the activity of apoptosis. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining confirmed that the process of apoptosis was significantly induced by BZO at concentration of 150 mg L-1. FITC-phalloidin actin-cytoskeleton staining combined with hyphal cell wall staining and hyphal ultrastructure studies further confirmed that BZO disrupted the cell membrane and hyphal morphology through disrupting the cytoskeleton, eventually inhibiting the growth of hyphae. These data demonstrated that BZO has multiple modes of action and may act as potential leading compound for the development of new oomycete fungicides. These results also showed that the combination of transcriptomic and proteomic approaches was a useful method for exploring the novel antifungal mechanisms of natural compounds.

30782361|a|The autoimmune diseases systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjogren's syndrome (SS) are diagnosed by detection of autoantibodies against Ro and La protein autoantigens, respectively. In this work, the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases SLE and SS was demonstrated using thermophoresis of Escherichia coli with the autodisplayed autoantigens. Ro and La protein autoantigens were autodisplayed by constitutive expression together with a fluorescent protein called tdTomato in the cytosol. The binding affinity of the autodisplayed autoantigens was tested against positive and control sera by using FACS as a reference method. The factors influencing interactions between E. coli with autodisplayed autoantigens and autoantibodies in sera during thermophoresis were analyzed by measurement of cell surface charge and size before and after interaction. Finally, the thermophoretic diagnosis of autoimmune diseases SLE and SS was demonstrated using sera from patients afflicted with the respective diseases by estimating sensitivity and selectivity from ROC plots.

30782363|t|Homogeneous peptide-break assay for luminescent detection of enzymatic protein post-translational modification activity utilizing charged peptides.
30782363|a|We have developed a rapid and sensitive universal peptide-based time-resolved luminescence assay for detection of enzymatic post-translational modifications (PTMs). PTMs play essential roles in intracellular signaling and cell regulation, thus providing functional protein diversity in cell. Due this, impaired PTM patterns have been linked to multiple disease states. Clear link between PTMs and pathological conditions have also driven assay development further, but still today most of the methodologies are based on single-specificity or group-specific PTM-recognition. We have previously introduced leuzine-zipper based peptide-break technology as a viable option for universal PTM detection. Here, we introduce peptide-break technology utilizing single-label homogeneous quenching resonance energy transfer (QRET) and charge-based peptide-peptide interaction. We demonstrate the functionality of the new assay concept in phosphorylation, deacetylation, and citrullination. In a comparable study between previously introduced leucine-zipper and the novel charge-based approach, we found equal PTM detection performance and sensitivity, but the peptide design for new targets is simplified with the charged peptides. The new concept allows the use of short &lt;20 amino acid peptides without limitations rising from the leucine-zipper coiled-coil structure. Introduced methodology enables wash-free PTM detection in a 384-well plate format, using low nanomolar enzyme concentrations. Potentially, the peptide-break technique using charged peptides may be applicable for natural peptide sequences directly obtained from the target protein.

30782365|t|Smartphone-based fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay platform for highly sensitive point-of-care detection of Zika virus nonstructural protein 1.
30782365|a|Simple, inexpensive, and rapid diagnostic tests in low-resource settings with limited laboratory equipment and technical expertise are instrumental in reducing morbidity and mortality from epidemic infectious diseases. We developed a smartphone-based fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) platform for the highly sensitive point-of-care detection of Zika virus nonstructural protein 1 (ZIKV NS1). An attachment was designed and 3D-printed to integrate the smartphone with external optical and electrical components, enabling the miniaturization of the instrument and reduction in cost and complexity. Quantum dot microspheres were utilized as probes in fluorescent LFIA because of their extremely bright fluorescence signal. This approach can achieve quantitative point-of-care detection of ZIKV NS1 within 20 min. Limits of detection (LODs) in buffer and serum were 0.045 and 0.15 ng mL-1, respectively. Despite the high structural similarity, a high-level Dengue virus NS1 as interferent showed limited cross-reactivity. Furthermore, this assay was successfully applied to detecte ZIKV NS1 and virions spiked in complex biological samples, indicating its practical application capability. Given its low cost, compact size, and excellent analytical performance, the proposed smartphone-based fluorescent LFIA platform holds considerable potential in rapid and accurate point-of-care detection of ZIKV NS1 and provides new insight into the design and application of molecular diagnostic methods in low-resource settings.

30782366|a|Composite nanomaterials are particularly useful and offer many excellent opportunities for electrochemical sensing application. Depending on the high catalytic activity of bimetallic nanoparticles, the large specific surface area, abundant active edges and co-catalytic function of MoS2 nanosheets, we, for the first time, prepared a novel PtNi bimetallic nanoparticles loaded MoS2 nanosheets (PtNi@MoS2) hybrid material by a co-reduction method for the electrochemical sensing application. The nanocomposite is characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and then casted on a bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to fabricate an electrochemical sensor (PtNi@MoS2/GCE). The electrochemical investigation showed that the sensor performed good selectivity and wide linear ranges for the simultaneous detection of dopamine (0.5-150 muM) and uric acid (0.5-600 muM). And the detection limits were down to 0.1 muM (S/N = 3) for both analytes.

30782374|t|Oxidation etching induced dual-signal response of carbon dots/silver nanoparticles system for ratiometric optical sensing of H2O2 and H2O2-related bioanalysis.
30782374|a|Ratiometric sensing suffers from less interference and can obtain more accurate results than single-signal assay. Here, a new ratiometric optical sensing strategy for H2O2 detection is developed by etching silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to deactivate fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and reduce Rayleigh scattering based on a hyphenated technique of fluorescence and second-order Rayleigh scattering (SRS). The ratiometric detection of H2O2 is achieved through exploiting a hybrid system fabricated by fluorescent carbon dots and silver nanoparticles (CDs/AgNPs). In the CDs/AgNPs system, the fluorescence of CDs is quenched because of FRET, and the scattering is strong due to the intrinsic high light-scattering power of AgNPs. With the introduction of H2O2, the AgNPs are etched and the CDs are released from the AgNP surface, resulting in the fluorescence enhancement and scattering decline. As a result, ratiometric sensing of H2O2 can be achieved based on the CDs/AgNPs system by simultaneous collection of fluorescence and SRS signals. The sensing system is further used for H2O2-generation bioanalysis, and as a proof-of-concept, ratiometric assay of glucose and evaluation of glucose oxidase activity are performed successfully. This work provides a new perspective for sensing applications of plasmonic nanoparticles.

30782376|t|Unlocking the hidden talent of DNA: Unexpected catalytic activity for colorimetric assay of alkaline phosphatase.
30782376|a|Carboxylic acids have been efficiently used to activate H2O2 to form even more potent oxidant-peroxy acids through enzyme-catalyzed processes. By employing acetic acid as the activator, herein we report for the first time that cofactor-free DNA displays unexpected activity in H2O2-mediated oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) under mild conditions. A series of 10-nt oligonucleotides were rationally designed with various combinations of double nucleotides including TG, AG, CG, TA and AC respectively, which demonstrates that the catalytic performance of DNA is highly dependent upon the sequence composition, strand length and continuous nucleotides. Inspired by phosphate-induced inhibition effects on the formation of peracetic acid, an ultrasensitive assay was well-established for monitoring alkaline phosphatase (ALP) on the basis of double terminal-phosphorylated G-rich oligonucleotides. Phosphorylated DNA not only serves as the substrate for ALP-catalyzed hydrolysis, but also acts as the enzyme-like catalyst for signal amplification. Quantitative determination of ALP is realized in a linear range from 0.05 to 15 mU/mL, resulting in the limit of detection of 0.01 mU/mL. The rapid and reliable test also has great potential in analyzing serum samples for practical disease diagnosis.

30783609|t|PINK1 Interacts with VCP/p97 and Activates PKA to Promote NSFL1C/p47 Phosphorylation and Dendritic Arborization in Neurons.
30783609|a|While PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) is well characterized for its role in mitochondrial homeostasis, much less is known concerning its ability to prevent synaptodendritic degeneration. Using unbiased proteomic methods, we identified valosin-containing protein (VCP) as a major PINK1-interacting protein. RNAi studies demonstrate that both VCP and its cofactor NSFL1C/p47 are necessary for the ability of PINK1 to increase dendritic complexity. Moreover, PINK1 regulates phosphorylation of p47, but not the VCP co-factor UFD1. Although neither VCP nor p47 interact directly with PKA, we found that PINK1 binds and phosphorylates the catalytic subunit of PKA at T197 [PKAcat(pT197)], a site known to activate the PKA holoenzyme. PKA in turn phosphorylates p47 at a novel site (S176) to regulate dendritic complexity. Given that PINK1 physically interacts with both the PKA holoenzyme and the VCP-p47 complex to promote dendritic arborization, we propose that PINK1 scaffolds a novel PINK1-VCP-PKA-p47 signaling pathway to orchestrate dendritogenesis in neurons. These findings highlight an important mechanism by which proteins genetically implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD; PINK1) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD; VCP) interact to support the health and maintenance of neuronal arbors.

30784437|t|Hierarchical Ag-SiO2@Fe3O4 magnetic composites for elemental mercury removal from non-ferrous metal smelting flue gas.
30784437|a|Hierarchical Ag-SiO2@Fe3O4 magnetic composites were selected for elemental mercury (Hg0) removal from non-ferrous metal smelting flue gas in this study. Results showed that the hierarchical Ag-SiO2@Fe3O4 magnetic composites had favorable Hg0 removal ability at low temperature. Moreover, the adsorption capacity of hierarchical magnetic composite is much larger than that of pure Fe3O4 and SiO2@Fe3O4. The Hg0 removal efficiency reached the highest value as approximately 92% under the reaction temperature of 150 C, while the removal efficiency sharply reduced in the absence of O2. The characterization results indicated that Ag nanoparticles grew on the surface of SiO2@Fe3O4 support. The large surface area of SiO2 supplied efficient reaction room for Hg and Ag atoms. Ag-Hg amalgam is generated on the surface of the composites. In addition, this magnetic material could be easily separated from fly ashes when adopted for treating real flue gas, and the spent materials could be regenerated using a simple thermal-desorption method.

30784446|t|Long-term impacts of graphene oxide and Ag nanoparticles on anammox process: Performance, microbial community and toxic mechanism.
30784446|a|The increasing application of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) has posed an emerging challenge to constructed wetland wastewater treatment. The performance, microbial community and toxic mechanism of anammox-based unplanted subsurface-flow constructed wetlands (USFCWs) were investigated under the long-term exposure of different graphene oxides (GOs) and Ag NP concentrations. Results showed that the addition of GO could promote TN removal, manifesting as function anammox bacteria C. Anammoxoglobus having a relative high abundance, for GO did not cause significant damage to the cell integrity though there was an increase in ROS concentrations. TN removal would not be obviously affected under exposure of 1 mg/L Ag NPs, for the function gene related to cell biogenesis and repair was up-regulated; while the addition of 10 mg/L Ag NPs would have an inhibiting effect on TN removal in the USFCWs, for the disappearance of some species having anammox ability. Key enzymes of anammox process (NIR and HDH) decreased to some extent under GO and Ag NP exposure, and function gene of defense mechanisms had an increase trend in samples.

30784447|t|Enhanced adsorption of arsenate by spinel zinc ferrite nano particles: Effect of zinc content and site occupation.
30784447|a|In this work, zinc ferrite spinel with different zinc contents (ZnxFe3-xO4) was synthesized by a hydrothermal method and used for removing As(V) in aqueous solution. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicated that in the crystal structure of ZnxFe3-xO4, the zinc atoms tended to occupy the octahedral sites for x &lt; 0.6 and diffused into the tetrahedral sites gradually with x &gt; 0.6. The size of ZnxFe3-xO4 crystallites increased with the increasing zinc content. Batch adsorption experiments showed that the adsorption isotherms could be well described by the Langmuir model, while the adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Zinc ferrite exhibited the highest adsorption capacity towards As(V) when x = 0.6. Study of the mechanism indicated that doping with zinc increased the number of surface hydroxyl groups on ferrite spinel, and thus enhanced the adsorption capacity when x = 0.6. This work revealed the effects of doping site and content of metal atoms on the adsorption ability of ferrite spinel towards As(V).

30784450|t|Stable-isotope probing of bacterial community for dissolved inorganic carbon utilization in Microcystis aeruginosa-dominated eutrophic water.
30784450|a|Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is an important source of carbon in aquatic ecosystems, especially under conditions of increased frequency of cyanobacterial bloom. However, the importance of bacteria in direct or indirect utilization of DIC has been widely overlooked in eutrophic freshwater. To identify the functional bacteria that can actively utilize DIC in eutrophic freshwater during cyanobacterial bloom, stable-isotope probing (SIP) experiments were conducted on eutrophic river water with or without inoculation with cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa). Our 16S rRNA sequencing results revealed the significance of Betaproteobacteria, with similar relative abundance as Alphaproteobacteria, in the active assimilation of H13CO3- into their DNA directly or indirectly, which include autotrophic genera Betaproteobacterial ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Other bacterial groups containing autotrophic members, e.g. Planctomycetes and Nitrospira, also presented higher abundance among free-living bacteria in water without cyanobacteria. Microcystis aggregates showed a preference for some specific bacterial members that may utilize H13CO3- metabolized by Microcystis as organic matter, e.g. Bacteroidetes (Cytophagales, Sphingobacteriales), and microcystin-degrading bacteria Betaproteobacteria (Paucibacter/Burkholderiaceae). This study provides some valuable information regarding the functional bacteria that can actively utilize DIC in eutrophic freshwater.

30784451|t|The balance of acidity and redox capability over modified CeO2 catalyst for the selective catalytic reduction of NO with NH3.
30784451|a|The effect of acidity and redox capability over sulfuric acid-modified CeO2 catalysts were studied for the selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 (NH3-SCR). The deposition of sulfate significantly enhanced the catalytic performance over CeO2. NOx conversion over 4H2SO4/CeO2 at 230-440  C was higher than 90%. The strong redox capability of CeO2 could result in unselective NH3 oxidation and decrease high temperatures catalytic activity and N2 selectivity. The deposition of sulfate increased the acidity and weakened the redox capability, and then increased the high temperature NOx conversion and N2 selectivity. An appropriate level of acidity also promoted the activity at 190-250  C over ceria-based catalysts, and with further increase in the acidity, the SCR activity decreased slightly. Weak redox capability lowered the low-temperature catalytic activity. Excellent SCR activity requires a balance of acidity and redox capability on the catalysts.

30784452|t|Carboxymethyl cellulose thiol-imprinted polymers: Synthesis, characterization and selective Hg(II) adsorption.
30784452|a|Sulfur containing ion imprinted polymers (S-IIPs) were applied for the uptake of Hg(II) from aqueous solution. Cysteamine which was used as the ligand for Hg(II) complexation, was grafted along the epichlorohydrin crosslinked carboxylated carboxymethyl cellulose polymer chain through an amide reaction. The adsorption ability of S-IIPs towards Hg(II) was investigated by kinetic and isotherm models, which, corresponding, showed that the adsorption process followed a pseudo-second-order, fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm with a maximum adsorption capacity of 80 mg/g. Moreover, thermodynamic studies indicated an endothermic and spontaneous reaction with the tendency of an enhanced randomness at the surface of the S-IIPs with temperature increases. S-IIPs indicated a high degree of selectivity towards Hg(II) in the presence of Cu2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+. Furthermore, the efficiency of S-IIPs was also evaluated against real samples showing 86.78%, 91.88%, and 99.10% recovery for Hg(II) wastewater, ground water and tap water, respectively. In this study, the adsorbent was successfully regenerated for five cycles, which allows for their reuse without significant loss of initial adsorption capability.

30784453|t|Characteristics of one-year observation of VOCs, NOx, and O3 at an urban site in Wuhan, China.
30784453|a|A continuous online observation of ozone and its precursors (NOx, VOCs) was carried out in central urban Wuhan from September 2016 to August 2017. The concentration levels of ozone, NOx, VOCs and their variations in urban Wuhan were analyzed, as well as effects of VOCs on ozone photochemical generation and the main controlling factors for ozone production. During the observation period, the average concentrations of ozone and NOx in Wuhan was 22.63 and 30.14 ppbv, respectively, and the average concentration of VOCs was 32.61 ppbv (42.3% alkanes, 13.0% alkenes, 10.0% aromatics, 7.3% acetylene, 9.9% OVOCs, and 10.5% halohydrocarbons). Ozone concentration was higher in spring and summer as compared with autumn and winter, wheras VOCs and NOx concentratios were lower in spring and summer but higher in autumn and winter. Aromatics and alkenes, two of VOCs species, showed the highest contributions to ozone formation potential in Wuhan (35.7% alkenes, 35.4 aromatics, 17.5% alkanes, 8.6% OVOCs, 1.6% halogenated hydrocarbons, and 1.4% acetylene). Among all VOCs species, those with the highest contribution were ethylene, m-xylene, toluene, propylene and o-xylene. The contribution of these five compounds to the total ozone formation potential concentration was 43.90%. Ozone-controlling factors in Wuhan changed within one day; during the early morning hours (6:00-9:00), VOCs/NOx was low, and ozone generation followed a VOCs-limited regime. However, during the peak time of ozone concentration (12:00-16:00), the ratio of VOCs/NOx was relatively high, suggesting that ozone generation followed a NOx-limited regime.

30784458|t|Adsorption of single and mixed haloacetonitriles on silica-based porous materials: Mechanisms and effects of porous structures.
30784458|a|Adsorption mechanisms and the role of different porous and crystalline structures on the removal of five haloacetonitriles (HANs) over hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS), titanium substituted mesoporous silica (Ti-HMS), rod-shaped SBA-15 and microporous zeolite NaY were investigated. In addition, the effect of pH on adsorption mechanism and selective adsorption of five HANs individually and in an equimolar mixed solution were evaluated. The results indicated that the intraparticle diffusion rate constants of the mesoporous adsorbents were higher than that of the microporous NaY. In single solute, the order of adsorption preference (highest to lowest) was mono-HANs &gt; di-HANs &gt; tri-HAN. However, in mixed solute, the large molecular weight of the tri-HAN and di-HANs are more easily adsorbed than the smaller molecular weight mono-HANs. Except for SBA-15, the order of adsorption capacities in mixed HANs solute was not different compared to that observed for the single HAN solute, which might be caused by the higher accessibility to the active sites due to larger pore size. The ion-dipole electrostatic interaction was likely to be the main adsorption mechanism, and was favored at high pH values due to the high negative surface charge density of the adsorbent. The molecular structure of the HANs and hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature affected the adsorption capacities and their selective adsorption from mixed solutes.

30784464|t|Three-dimensional biogenic C-doped Bi2MoO6/In2O3-ZnO Z-scheme heterojunctions derived from a layered precursor.
30784464|a|Novel 3D biogenic C-doped Bi2MoO6/In2O3-ZnO Z-scheme heterojunctions were synthesized for the first time, using cotton fiber as template. The as-prepared samples showed excellent adsorption and photodegradation performance toward the hazardous antibiotic doxycycline under simulated sunlight irradiation. The morphology, phase composition and in situ carbon doping could be precisely controlled by adjusting processing parameters. The carbon doping in Bi2MoO6/In2O3-ZnO was derived from the cotton template, and the carbon content could be varied in the range 0.9-4.4 wt.% via controlling the heat treatment temperature. The sample with Bi2MoO6/In2O3-ZnO molar ratio of 1:2 and carbon content of 1.1 wt.% exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity toward doxycycline degradation, which was 3.6 and 4.3 times higher than those of pure Bi2MoO6 and ZnInAl-CLDH (calcined layered double hydroxides), respectively. It is believed that the Z-scheme heterojunction with C-doping, the 3D hierarchically micro-meso-macro porous structure, as well as the high adsorption capacity, contributed significantly to the enhanced photocatalytic activity.

30784465|t|Effects of temperature and SO3 on re-emission of mercury from activated carbon under flue gas conditions.
30784465|a|Mercury (Hg) is a toxic and bio-accumulating heavy metal that is predominantly released via the combustion of coal. Due to its toxicity, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has introduced Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) Rule regarding allowable Hg emissions. In order to reduce emissions, power plants have widely adopted activated carbon (AC) injection. AC injection has proven to be an effective method to reduce Hg emissions, but the re-emission of previously adsorbed Hg during unit operation, likely due to changing temperature or flue gas composition, could be problematic. This study specifically examined the effects of temperature and sulfur trioxide (SO3) concentration, by ramping temperature and SO3 concentration independently and simultaneously, on AC samples that are already exposed to flue gas and saturated in presence of Hg, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitric oxide (NO). Of these two suspected factors to cause re-emission, temperature had the greater impact and resulted in re-emission of both elemental and oxidized Hg with a greater fraction of oxidized Hg, which can be attributed to elemental Hg being more strongly bonded to the AC surface. Surprisingly, exposing the samples to increasing concentrations of SO3 had nearly no effect under the conditions examined in this study, possibly as a result of the samples being already saturated with sulfur prior to the SO3 ramp tests to simulate transient conditions in the plant.

30784468|t|Assessing the capacity of biochar to stabilize copper and lead in contaminated sediments using chemical and extraction methods.
30784468|a|Because of its high adsorption capacity, biochar has been used to stabilize metals when remediating contaminated soils; to date, however, it has seldom been used to remediate contaminated sediment. A biochar was used as a stabilization agent to remediate Cu- and Pb-contaminated sediments, collected from three locations in or close to Beijing. The sediments were mixed with a palm sawdust gasified biochar at a range of weight ratios (2.5%, 5%, and 10%) and incubated for 10, 30, or 60 days. The performance of the different treatments and the heavy metal fractions in the sediments were assessed using four extraction methods, including diffusive gradients in thin films, the porewater concentration, a sequential extraction, and the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure. The results showed that biochar could enhance the stability of heavy metals in contaminated sediments. The degree of stability increased as both the dose of biochar and the incubation time increased. The sediment pH and the morphology of the metal crystals adsorbed onto the biochar changed as the contact time increased. Our results showed that adsorption, metal crystallization, and the pH were the main controls on the stabilization of metals in contaminated sediment by biochar.

30797458|t|Quantum dot modified interface for electrochemical immunosensing of procalcitonin for the detection of urinary tract infection.
30797458|a|An electrochemical immunoelectrode is fabricated and investigated for quantification of the Procalcitonin (PCT), a protein over expressed in urinary tract infection (UTI). The sensor electrode is prepared by self assembling the conjugate of Zinc sulfide capped Cadmium selenide quantum dots (QD) and PCT specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) over the indium-tin-oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate. The presence of QD in the conjugate is found to provide more electroactive surface area and improved electron transfer kinetics and diffusion coefficient to the immunoelectrode. The electrochemical characteristics of this immunoelectrode towards synthetic PCT sample reveal specificity among the pool of various analytes. The sensing characteristics reveal that the sensor can potentially detect PCT over a concentration of 0.21 ng/mL which is above pathological range in healthy person. However, in absence of QD, the detection range lies in between 0.1 mug/mL to 10 mug/mL, which is far above the expressed concentration of PCT in UTI. Under optimal conditions, the QD based immunoelectrode exhibited good calibration range from 1 ng/ml to 10 mug/mL.

30806240|t|Lutein Inhibits Cell Growth and Activates Apoptosis via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathway in A549 Human Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Cells.
30806240|a|Cancer, the uncontrolled growth of cells, is a major disease that threatens the worldwide population. Among all cancer types, lung cancer has the highest morbidity rate, with a survival rate of less than 5%. Various studies have focused on discovering a potent anticancer drug that will increase the survival rate of lung cancer patients. Lutein (3,3'-dihydroxy-beta, epsilon-carotene), a carotenoid present in fruits and vegetables, is one such compound that possesses excellent antioxidant properties. The present study was designed to determine the anticancer effect of lutein against A549, a non-small-cell lung cancer cell line. The cytotoxic effect of lutein against lung cancer cells (A549 and HCC827) and normal cells (BEAS-2B) was detected by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The Transwell assay was performed to detect the inhibitory potential of lutein against cell invasion and migration of A549 cells. The induction of apoptosis by lutein in A549 was analyzed by a double-staining technique using TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling) and DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining assays to confirm the molecular mechanism exhibited by lutein to induce apoptosis through regulating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling molecules that are often deregulated in cancerous condition. The results show that lutein inhibits the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and induces apoptosis in A549, which may therefore be used as a potent natural anticancer drug with no side effects to treat lung cancer.

30824020|t|Cloning and molecular characterization of three lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases expressed in flax seeds.
30824020|a|In the context of the growing demand for alpha-linolenic acid due to its high nutritional value as a polyunsaturated fatty acid, we have investigated the contribution of 2-lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT) enzymes from flax (Linum usitatissimum) in the accumulation of alpha-linolenic acid into the oil fraction of flax seed. We have isolated the cDNAs encoding three class A microsomal LPAAT2 isoforms from developing flax seeds. The three isoforms, denominated LPAAT2A, LPAAT2A2 and LPAAT2B, are able to complement the LPAAT deficient JC201 E. coli mutant, confirming their functionality. We have performed enzymatic assays showing that the specific activity of the LPAAT2A isoform is significantly higher than that of the LPAAT2A2 and LPAAT2B toward the unsaturated oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids. Moreover, LPAAT2A presents in vitro a high specificity and selectivity for linoleic and linolenic acids as compared to saturated fatty acids. The three isoforms are expressed during all the stages of seed development and in stem and leaf tissues, as shown by an analysis of the transcription level of the corresponding genes. The heterologous expression of LPAAT2A in Arabidopsis seeds leads to an increase in the accumulation of linoleic and linolenic acids in the oil fraction of the seeds from two transgenic lines.

30824031|t|Maize factors ZmUBP15, ZmUBP16 and ZmUBP19 play important roles for plants to tolerance the cadmium stress and salt stress.
30824031|a|Ubiquitin-Specific Protease16 (UBP16) has been described involved in cadmium stress and salt stress in Arabidopsis, however nothing is known about the functions of its homologs in maize. In this study, we investigate the functions of ZmUBP15, ZmUBP16 and ZmUBP19, three Arabidopsis UBP16 homologs in maize. Our results indicate that ZmUBP15, ZmUBP16 and ZmUBP19 are ubiquitously expressed throughout plant development, and ZmUBP15, ZmUBP16 and ZmUBP19 proteins are mainly localized in plasma membrane. Complementation analyses show that over-expression of ZmUBP15 or ZmUBP16 can rescue the defective phenotype of ubp16-1 in cadmium stress. In addition, over-expression of ZmUBP15, ZmUBP16 or ZmUBP19 can increase the plant tolerance to cadmium stress. These results indicate that ZmUBP15, ZmUBP16 and ZmUBP19 are required for plant to tolerance the cadmium stress. Consistent with this point, cadmium-related genes are markedly up-regulated in seedlings over-expressing ZmUBP15, ZmUBP16 or ZmUBP19. Furthermore, our data indicate that ZmUBP15, ZmUBP16 and ZmUBP19 partially rescue the salt-stress phenotype of ubp16-1. Thus, our research uncover the functions of three novel maize proteins, ZmUBP15, ZmUBP16 and ZmUBP19, which are required for plants in response to cadmium stress and salt stress.

30824054|t|Arabidopsis Ca2+-dependent nuclease AtCaN2 plays a negative role in plant responses to salt stress.
30824054|a|Eukaryotic nucleases are involved in processes such as DNA restriction digestion, repair, recombination, transposition, and programmed cell death (PCD). Studies on the role of nucleases have mostly focused on PCD during plant development, while the information on nucleases involved in responses to different abiotic stress conditions remains limited. Here, we identified a Ca2+-dependent nuclease, AtCaN2, in Arabidopsis thaliana and characterized its activity, expression patterns, and involvement in plant responses to salt stress. AtCaN2 showed a dual endonuclease and exonuclease activity, being able to degrade circular plasmids, RNA, single-stranded DNA, and double-stranded DNA. Expression analysis showed that AtCaN2 was strongly induced in senescent siliques and by salt stress. Overexpression of AtCaN2 decreased the plant tolerance to salt stress conditions, leading to an excessive H2O2 accumulation. However, an atcan2 mutant showed better tolerance to salt stress and a lower level of H2O2 accumulation. Moreover, the expression of several genes (AtAPX1, AtGPX8, and AtSOD1), encoding reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzymes (ascorbate peroxidase 1, glutathione peroxidase 8, and superoxide dismutase 1, respectively), was highly induced in the atcan2 mutant under salt stress conditions. In addition, salt-stress-induced cell death was increased in the AtCaN2-overexpressing transgenic plant but decreased in the atcan2 mutant. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that AtCaN2 plays a negative role in plant tolerance to salt stress. A AtCaN2 knock out could reduce ROS accumulation, decrease ROS-induced PCD, and improve overall plant tolerance.

30824055|t|Eukaryotic peptide chain release factor 1 participates in translation termination of specific cysteine-poor prolamines in rice endosperm.
30824055|a|Prolamines are alcohol-soluble proteins classified as either cysteine-poor (CysP) or cysteine-rich (CysR) based on whether they can be alcohol-extracted without or with reducing agents, respectively. In rice esp1 mutants, various CysP prolamines exhibit both reduced and normal amounts of isoelectric focusing bands, indicating that the mutation affects only certain prolamine classes. To examine the genetic regulation of CysP prolamine synthesis and accumulation, we constructed a high-resolution genetic linkage map of ESP1. The ESP1 gene was mapped to within a 20 kb region on rice chromosome 7. Sequencing analysis of annotated genes in this region revealed a single-nucleotide polymorphism within eukaryotic peptide chain release factor (eRF1), which participates in stop-codon recognition and nascent-polypeptide release from ribosomes during translation. A subsequent complementation test revealed that ESP1 encodes eRF1. We also identified UAA as the stop codon of CysP prolamines with reduced concentration in esp1 mutants. Recognition assays and microarray analysis confirmed that ESP1/eRF1 recognizes UAA/UAG, but not UGA. Our results provide convincing evidence that ESP1/eRF1 participates in the translation termination of CysP prolamines during seed development.

30824056|t|Functional conservation of CYCLOPS in crack entry legume Arachis hypogaea.
30824056|a|Root nodule symbiosis in legumes is established following interaction of compatible rhizobia that activates an array of genes, commonly known as symbiotic-pathway, resulting in nodule development. In model legumes, bacterial entry mainly occurs through infection thread involving the expression of transcription factor CYCLOPS/IPD3. Here we show the functional analysis of AhCYCLOPS in Arachis hypogaea where bacteria invade roots through epidermal cracks. Exploiting significant cross-species domain conservation, trans-complementation experiments involving ectopic expression of AhCYCLOPS in transgenic hairy-roots of Medicago truncatula ipd3 mutants resulted in functional complementation of Medicago nodules. Moreover, native promoter of AhCYCLOPS was sufficient for this cross-species complementation irrespective of the different modes of infection of roots by rhizobia and nodule ontology. To unravel the role of AhCYCLOPS during 'crack-entry' nodulation in A. hypogaea, RNAi of AhCYCLOPS was performed which resulted in delayed nodule inception followed by drastic reduction in nodule number on transgenic hairy-roots. The infection zone of a significant number of RNAi nodules showed presence of infected cells with enlarged nucleus and rod shaped undifferentiated bacteria. Expression analysis showed downregulation of several nodulation responsible effectors endorsing the compromised condition of RNAi roots. Together, the results indicated that AhCYCLOPS plays an important role in A. hypogaea nodule development.

30824057|t|Histone modification and activation by SOC1-like and drought stress-related transcription factors may regulate AcSVP2 expression during kiwifruit winter dormancy.
30824057|a|The SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP)-like and DORMANCY ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX (DAM) genes have been shown to regulate winter dormancy in woody perennials. In kiwifruit, AcSVP2 affects the duration of dormancy in cultivars that require high chill for dormancy release. In this study, we used a low-chill kiwifruit Actinidia chinensis 'Hort16A' to further study the function and regulation of AcSVP2. Overexpression of AcSVP2 in transgenic A. chinensis delayed budbreak in spring. A reduction in the active trimethylation histone marks of the histone H3K4 and acetylation of histone H3 contributed to the reduction of AcSVP2 expression towards dormancy release, while the inactive histone marks of trimethylation of the histone H3K27 and H3K9 in AcSVP2 locus did not show significant enrichment at the end of winter dormancy. Analysis of expression in shoot buds showed that AcSVP2 transcript was elevated in dormant buds during winter months and declined prior to budbreak, which was coordinated with expression of some of kiwifruit SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1)-like genes. Screening of 101 transcription factors in an assay with a 2.3 kb promoter region of AcSVP2 found that kiwifruit SOC1-like genes are able to activate the AcSVP2 promoter. We further identified additional transcription factors associated with drought/osmotic stress and dormancy which may regulate AcSVP2 expression.

30841381|t|Effects of free nitrous acid and nitrite on two-phase anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge: A preliminary study.
30841381|a|Nitrite, a product of the nitritation of sewage or digestion liquid, has been used to pretreat waste activated sludge (WAS) before anaerobic digestion. In this study, the effects of free nitrous acid (FNA) and nitrite on two-phase anaerobic sludge bioconversion were investigated. The experimental results indicated that both nitrite and FNA promoted sludge organic solubilization. Notably, nitrite promoted volatile fatty acids (VFAs) accumulation while FNA inhibited VFA accumulation in the first phase (acidogenic phase). In the second phase (methanogenic phase), neither nitrite nor FNA improved the net cumulative methane production from WAS. Although net cumulative methane production was not enhanced by the addition of nitrite or FNA, the volatile solids (VS) degradation rate was improved with nitrite addition in the two-phase anaerobic digestion process, indicating that nitrite is more favorable than FNA for the two-phase anaerobic digestion of WAS. It is expected that these findings can offer useful insights into future design of anaerobic digestion system with the treatment by the nitrite from digestion liquid.

30841783|t|Progesterone receptor expression in proliferating cancer cells of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer.
30841783|a|Breast cancer has been suggested to have two distinct driving mechanisms: the hormone receptor and the growth factor receptor pathways. We hypothesized that each driving system produces a different expression pattern of estrogen-regulated genes, such as progesterone receptor, in proliferating cells. Progesterone receptor and Ki67 expressions were assessed by dual-fluorescence immunohistochemistry in estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer tissues. Two distinct proliferating cell populations were observed: progesterone-receptor-positive and progesterone-receptor-negative. In the training cohort, tissues with progesterone-receptor-positive proliferating cells were associated with lower grade and better disease-free survival (p = 0.0055 and 0.0026, respectively). These associations were confirmed in the validation cohort from the neoadjuvant endocrine trial JFMC34 (p = 0.033 and 0.0003, respectively). In the validation cohort, patients with progesterone-receptor-positive proliferating cells responded better to endocrine therapy and had a lower Oncotype DX Recurrence Score. In the multivariate analysis, progesterone receptor status of proliferating cells, but not progesterone receptor or Ki67 alone, was an independent predictor of disease-free survival in both cohorts (p = 0.0043 and 0.0026). In conclusion, the progesterone receptor status of proliferating cancer cells was associated with histological grade and Recurrence Score, and a potent prognostic factor in estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancers. Results suggest that different driving systems generate different expression patterns of progesterone receptor in proliferating cancer cells. Further studies are warranted to validate the findings.

30848745|t|[Conventional serum tumor markers in liver cancer. Retrospective analysis of 118 patients].
30848745|a|BACKGROUND: Conventional serum tumor markers (CSTM) are widely used for monitoring patients with cancer. However, their usefulness as a diagnostic tool is controversial in primary or metastatic liver cancer (PMLC). AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the most commonly requested CSTM in the diagnostic approach of PMLC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Review of medical records of patients aged over 18 years with a liver biopsy, attended from 2005 to 2017 in a tertiary hospital and a regional cancer center in Colombia. The results of liver biopsies were compared with tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), CA 19-9, CA 125 and prostate specific antigen (PSA) using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: We reviewed 2063 medical records and retrieved 118 eligible patients (59 cases and 59 controls, 70% males). Thirty percent had obstructive jaundice. There was heterogeneity in the amount of tumor markers requested according to medical criteria. Only CA 19-9 showed discriminative capacity (&gt; 17.6 U/m), with a cut-off point lower than that reported in the literature and a sensitivity of 69.5%, specificity of 91.6%, a positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 8.32, and a negative LR of 0.33. CONCLUSIONS: Except for CA 19-9, tumor markers were not useful for the initial diagnostic approach in patients with suspected primary or metastatic malignant liver tumors.

30857079|t|Groundwater nutrient inputs into an urbanized tropical estuary system in Indonesia.
30857079|a|Groundwater discharge is known to transport nutrients into estuaries at several locations around the world. However, few studies report groundwater-associated nutrient fluxes from tropical developing regions such as Southeast Asia, even though this area shows the strongest human modifications in the coastal zone worldwide. We investigated groundwater nutrient flux into two streams and estuaries (Awur and Sekumbu Bay) in the urban area of Jepara, Indonesia, and its relation with the land usage surrounding the estuaries. We found that average concentrations of NO3, NH4, and PO4 in Jepara's aquifer reached 145muM, 68muM, and 14muM, respectively, and our results indicate that these were mainly originated from untreated sewage, agriculture, and manure input. Approximately 2200tonNyear-1 and 380tonPyear-1 were removed in the soil and aquifer before the nutrients were discharged into the river. The total groundwater discharge into the river and estuary was estimated to 461x103m3d-1, or up to 42% of the river discharge. Discharge of groundwater-associated NO3 (72x103mold-1), NH4 (34x103mold-1), PO4 (5x103mold-1), and additional surface runoff may contribute to eutrophication and a decrease of nearshore surface water quality. Nutrient concentrations in groundwater, river, and coastal seawater in the Jepara region are similar to those found in major urban areas in Southeast Asia, e.g. Manila and Bangkok, even though Jepara has smaller size and population. Thus, our results indicate that medium populated cities with highly modified regional land use can contribute a significant amount of nutrient discharge in the coastal area and should be included in global assessments of nutrient budget calculation.

30857087|t|In vivo fractionation of mercury isotopes in tissues of a mammalian carnivore (Neovison vison).
30857087|a|The use of isotope ratios to trace Hg contamination sources in environmental compartments is now generally accepted. However, for biota and especially for mammals, it is still unknown if and/or how Hg isotopes fractionate in vivo and which tissue is most representative of the source(s) of contamination. We measured fractionation of Hg in mink (Neovison vison) tissues (fur, brain, blood, liver, kidney) collected during a controlled feeding experiment where captive mink were fed differing amounts of methylmercury. There was no significant effect of dietary MeHg concentrations on Hg fractionation in most tissues. Net fractionation of Hg, i.e., fractionation corrected for diet (delta202Hgtissue-delta202Hgdiet) was observed in all tissues with the greatest net fractionation occurring in the mink liver (-1.39%) and kidney (-0.95%). Less net fractionation, occurred in the brain (-0.12%), blood (0.38%) and fur (0.30%). In the absence of brain tissue, fur is a suitable proxy which is readily obtainable and can be non-lethally collected. In these mink, it appears that biochemical processes such as demethylation, contribute to significant fractionation of Hg in the liver and kidney, but not as much in the brain and fur, where transport of Hg via thiol-containing complexes may be more important.

30857089|t|Effects of rain shortage on carbon allocation, pools and fluxes in a Mediterranean shrub ecosystem - a 13C labelling field study.
30857089|a|Hydrological cycle is expected to become the primary cause of ecosystem's degradation in near future under changing climate. Rain manipulation experiments under field conditions provide accurate picture on the responses of biotic processes to changed water availability for plants. A field experiment, mimicking expected changes in rain patterns, was established in a Mediterranean shrub community at Porto Conte, Italy, in 2001. In November 2011 Cistus monspeliensis, one of the dominating shrub species in the Mediterranean basin, was 13C labelled on plots subjected to extended rain shortage period and on control non manipulated plots. Carbon (C) allocation was traced by 13C dynamics in shoots, shoot-respired CO2, roots, microbial biomass, K2SO4-extractable C and CO2 respired from soil. Most of the recovered 13C (60%) was respired by shoots within 2weeks in control plots. In rain shortage treatment, 13C remained incorporated in aboveground plant parts. Residence time of 13C in leaves was longer under the rain shortage because less 13C was lost by shoot respiration and because 13C was re-allocated to leaves from woody tissues. The belowground C sink was weak (3-4% of recovered 13C) and independent on rain manipulation. Extended rain shortage promoted C exudation into rhizosphere soil in expense of roots. Together with lowered photosynthesis, this "save" economy of new C metabolites reduces the growing season under rain shortage resulting in decrease of shrub cover and C losses from the system on the long-term.

30857097|t|Distribution of perfluorinated compounds (PFASs) in the aquatic environment of the industrially polluted Vaal River, South Africa.
30857097|a|Perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) are highly persistent chemicals, which have a bioaccumulative potential and can be found in wildlife around the world. Although multiple studies have been performed on PFASs pollution of the aquatic environment, little is known on PFASs pollution on the African continent and their possible risks for human health. In the present study, we examined the distribution of 15 PFASs in fish, invertebrates, sediment and water, collected at three sites, representing a gradient of industrial and mining pollution, along the Vaal River, South Africa. Furthermore, possible risks for human health through consumption of contaminated fish were examined. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was the most dominant PFAS measured in biota, whereas perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) was measured in higher concentrations in water. Mean PFAS concentrations in water ranged from &lt;LOQ to 38.5ng/L. PFAS concentrations in water decreased along the gradient and were similar or lower compared to other studies in Europe, Asia and America. PFAS measurements in sediment were &lt;LOQ, with the exception of PFOS at Thabela Thabeng (2.36ng/g dry weight (dw)). Average  PFAS concentrations in biota increased along the gradient and ranged from &lt;LOQ to 34.5ng/g wet weight (ww) in invertebrates, &lt;LOQ to 289ng/g ww in liver and &lt;LOQ to 34.0ng/g ww in muscle tissue. Although PFOS concentrations were relatively high compared to literature, concentrations of other PFASs were rather low. A potential risk for humans through consumption of PFAS-contaminated fish was assessed. Tolerable daily intake values (grams of fish that can be eaten daily without risking health effects) were much lower than the average South African fish consumption per day, implying a potential risk for human health through consumption of PFAS contaminated fish. CAPSULE: Concentrations of perfluorinated compounds in water, sediment, fish and invertebrates from the Vaal River were low or intermediate and posed a potential risk for human health through consumption of contaminated fish.

30857098|t|Seasonal changes in peryphytic microbial metabolism determining mercury methylation in a tropical wetland.
30857098|a|Mercury (Hg) methylation, a key process in the biogeochemical cycle of Hg, is mainly attributed to sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogenic Archaea. However, environmental regulation by these groups has not yet been ascertained in tropical environments, especially in respect to the seasonal flood flooding. This work evaluated the variation of net methylmercury production potential in relation to biological characteristics of the periphyton, environmental factors, and flood pulse seasons. Our results indicate that there is a seasonal change between metabolic groups as main Hg methylators, sulfate-reducing bacteria in the dry season and methanogenic Archaea in the flood season. In addition, there was a positive relationship between dissolved organic carbon (DOC), phosphorus, cyanobacteria biovolume, and periphytic Hg methylation potential. These results shed a new light on MeHg production plasticity, mediated by landscape and flood pulses in tropical wetlands, as well as on ecological relationships within the periphyton.

30857102|t|Bioremediation of triphenyl phosphate by Brevibacillus brevis: Degradation characteristics and role of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase.
30857102|a|Triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) has been detected with increasing frequency in environmental samples, which has aroused great attention regarding its potential adverse effects. In this study, biodegradation of TPHP by Brevibacillus brevis was investigated. The results revealed that the highest degradation efficiency of 3mumol/L TPHP by B. brevis reached 92.1% at pH7 and 30 C. The major metabolites of TPHP, diphenyl phosphate and phenyl phosphate were detected within 5days of incubation with the maximum concentrations at 308.2 and 11.8nmol/L, respectively. The activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase along with malondialdehyde content also increased significantly, indicating that TPHP caused a severe oxidative stress on B. brevis. Meanwhile, the addition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitor piperonyl butoxide markedly decreased the degradation of TPHP by B. brevis. Further transcription studies using quantitative real-time RT-PCR confirmed that the expression of CYP gene in B. brevis were significantly down-regulated. These findings demonstrated the important role of CYP in the degradation of TPHP. To our best knowledge, this is the first report about the biodegradation of TPHP by B. brevis. Overall, this study provides new insights into the potential mechanisms of TPHP biodegradation by microorganisms.

30857108|t|A novel approach for enhancing hydrogen production from bio-glycerol photoreforming by improving colloidal dispersion stability.
30857108|a|In photocatalytic systems, TiO2 based particles in suspensions tend to aggregate spontaneously, resulting in low efficiency for light utilization and photocatalytic activity. In this study, various TiO2 nanoparticles with different shapes were synthesized and characterized via various analysis. In atmosphere and aqueous environment, the nanoparticles demonstrated different properties in the nature of the agglomerations. Photocatalytic performances of the as-prepared samples were confirmed to be strongly influenced by the dispersion stabilities with TiO2 nanotube exhibited higher colloidal dispersion stability and photocatalytic activity. Mixing binary TiO2 photocatalysts with different shapes as a simple approach was firstly proposed for enhancing photoreforming hydrogen production from bio-glycerol aqueous solution. At a specific mixing ratio, the mixed suspension of TiO2 nanosphere and nanosheet retained excellent colloidal dispersion stability, and photocatalytic hydrogen production was significantly promoted with its maximum H2 production amount as 2.1-2.9 times high as that of TNP and TNS, respectively. This strategy of enhancing colloidal dispersion stability may provide new ideas for the design of efficient and energy-saving photocatalytic system.

30857630|t|Target-site and non-target-site-based resistance to tribenuron-methyl in multiply-resistant Myosoton aquaticum L.
30857630|a|Myosoton aquaticum L., a widespread and competitive winter weed of wheat in China, has evolved resistance to many classes of herbicides. In one M. aquaticum population (AH03), collected from Anhui Province, where tribenuron-methyl and florasulam had been used to control this weed resistance to both herbicides had evolved. Compared with the sensitive population, HN03(S), the resistant (R) population, AH03, was highly resistant to tribenuron-methyl, flucarbazone-Na and pyroxsulam, moderately resistant to pyrithiobac-sodium, and florasulam, and had low resistance to diflufenican. AH03 was still controlled by imazethapyr, 2,4-D butylate, fluroxypyr-meptyl, and isoproturon. Pretreatment with the P450 inhibitor malathion reduced the GR50 value of tribenuron-methyl by 43% in the R population, and by 25% in the S population. This indicates that P450-mediated enhanced metabolism is one likely mechanism for tribenuron-methyl resistance in M. aquaticum. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity could be induced by tribenuron-methyl in both the R and S populations. However, both the basal and induced GST activity of the R population was lower than that of the S population. The in vitro ALS assay confirmed that the ALS from the R plants showed a high resistance (52.93-fold) to tribenuron-methyl. ALS gene sequencing revealed a Pro197Ala substitution in the R plants. Based on the ALS gene sequence analysis, molecular markers were also developed to identify the specific Pro197Ala mutation. This population of M. aquaticum has multiple resistance and target-site (ALS Pro197Ala) and non-target-site resistance mechanisms contribute to tribenuron-methyl resistance.

30880703|t|Transcriptional response of AcrEF-TolC against fluoroquinolone and carbapenem in Escherichia coli of clinical origin.
30880703|a|Introduction: Efflux pump systems constitute a major means of intrinsic resistance in Escherichia coli. AcrEF-TolC pump is known to exhibit higher expression level in quinolone resistant isolates. However, the transcriptional response of this pump is yet to be known when exposed to quinolone and other group of antibiotics. Objective: The present study analyses the transcriptional response of AcrEF-TolC in the presence of quinolones and carbapenems. Methodology: A total of 167 non-duplicate clinical isolates from Silchar medical college and Hospital, Silchar, India were included in this study. Of which 27 were devoid of any carbapenemase activity and among them 13 isolates showed overexpression of AcrE and AcrF gene. Transcriptional response of AcrE was directly proportional to increasing concentration of levofloxacin and ofloxacin. However, the response of AcrE and AcrF was inconsistent with carbapenems. Result: The study isolates showed susceptibility towards amikacin (68.4%), gentamicin (59.6%), cefepime (52.7%) and pipercillin/tazobactam (48.3%). The present investigation highlights that apart from qnr genes and mutational changes in gyr region, AcrEF-TolC plays a major role in fluoroquinolone resistance in this part of the world. Conclusion: Upregulation of AcrE in the presence of levofloxacin and ofloxacin warrants further investigation to establish their active role in efflux of this drug.

30893392|t|Safety and efficacy of halobetasol propionate lotion 0.01% in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis: a pooled analysis of 2 phase 3 studies.
30893392|a|Potent topical corticosteroids (TCSs) are the mainstay of psoriasis treatment. Safety concerns have limited use to 2 to 4 weeks. The objective of our study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of once-daily halobetasol propionate (HP) lotion 0.01% in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis through 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 studies (N=430). Participants were randomized (2:1) to HP lotion 0.01% or vehicle once daily for 8 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of follow-up. The primary efficacy assessment was treatment success (at least a 2-grade improvement in baseline investigator global assessment [IGA] score and a score of 0 [clear] or 1 [almost clear]). Additional assessments included improvement in psoriasis signs and symptoms, body surface area (BSA), and a composite score of IGAxBSA. Safety and treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were evaluated throughout. We found that HP lotion 0.01% demonstrated statistically significant superiority over vehicle as early as week 2 and also was superior in reducing psoriasis signs and symptoms and BSA involvement.

30910085|t|Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of the food spoilage bacterium Brochothrix thermosphacta.
30910085|a|Microbial food spoilage is responsible for significant economic losses. Brochothrix thermosphacta is one of the major bacteria involved in the spoilage of meat and seafood. Its growth and metabolic activities during food storage result in the production of metabolites associated with off-odors. In this study, we evaluated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity of this species. A collection of 161 B. thermosphacta strains isolated from different foods, spoiled or not, and from a slaughterhouse environment was constituted from various laboratory collections and completed with new isolates. A PCR test based on the rpoB gene was developed for a fast screening of B. thermosphacta isolates. Strains were typed by MALDI-TOF MS, rep-PCR, and PFGE. Each typing method separated strains into distinct groups, revealing significant intra-species diversity. These classifications did not correlate with the ecological origin of strains. The ability to produce acetoin and diacetyl, two molecules associated with B. thermosphacta spoilage, was evaluated in meat and shrimp juices. The production level was variable between strains and the spoilage ability on meat or shrimp juice did not correlate with the substrate origin of strains. Although the B. thermosphacta species encompasses ubiquitous strains, spoiling ability is both strain- and environment-dependent.

31011396|t|Interstitial pneumonia in a glassblower: think to chronic beryllium disease!
31011396|a|Chronic beryllium disease (CBD) is an occupational illness with varying severity. In this report, we describe a 27 year old man, glassblower, who developed a fatal CBD after six months of unknown Beryllium's exposure. The diagnosis was suspected on histological examination and then consolidated by confirmation of Beryllium's exposure at the working area. Physicians should be aware of the potential risk to develop CBD in glassblowers. These workers should benefit from early medical surveillance using the Beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT) and therefore from suitable management.
